https://en.bd-pratidin.com/international/2025/05/14/37066 1/12Colombia formally
agreed on
Wednesday to join
China's vast Belt and
Road infrastructure
initiative, as Beijing
draws Latin America
closer in a bid to
counter the United States.
Latin America has emerged as a key battleground in US
President Donald Trump's confrontations with China, and
the region is coming under pressure from Washington to
choose a side.
China has surpassed the United States as the biggest
trading partner of Brazil, Peru, Chile and other Latin
American nations, and two-th irds of countries there have
signed up to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's Belt and Road
infrastructure drive.
On the sidelines of a major gathering of regional leaders
in Beijing on Wednesday , Colombia became the latest
country to join the massive global initiative.China has surpassed the US as the biggest trading partner of Brazil,

https://en.bd-pratidin.com/international/2025/05/14/37066 2/12Colombia's foreign ministry hailed the agreement as a
""historic step that opens up new opportunities for
investment, technological cooperation, and sustainable
development for both countries"".
And after a meeting with Colombian President Gustavo
Petro, Xi urged the countries to take the opportunity of
Colombia formally joining the ""Belt and Road Initiative
family"" to enhance their cooperation, Beijing's state media
said.
Posting a video of the signin g to social media platform X,
Petro wrote that ""the history of our foreign relations is
changing"".
""From now on, Colombia will interact with the entire world
on a footing of equality and freedom,"" he wrote.
The BRI is a central pillar of Xi's bid to expand China's
economic and political clout overseas.
For more than a decade, it has provided investment for
infrastructure and other large-scale projects around the
world, offering Beijing political and economic leverage in
return.
Last year, Xi inaugurated Latin America's first Beijing-
funded port in Chancay , Peru -- a symbol of the Asian

- 'Defenders of free trade' -
This week's China-CELAC Forum in Beijing has seen
China cast itself as the defender of the multilateral order
and the backer of the Global South, with Xi pledging on
Monday $9.2 billion in credit towards development.
That pledge was part of a broad set of initiatives aimed at
deepening cooperation, including on infrastructure and
clean energy .
Beijing will also cooperate in counterterrorism and fighting
transnational organised crime, Xi said, as well as
enhancing exchanges such as scholarships and training
programmes.
During a meeting with Chilean President Gabriel Boric on
Wednesday , Xi said that the ""resurgence of unilateralism
and protectionism is severel y impacting the international
economic and trade order"", according to Chinese state
news agency Xinhua.
""As staunch defenders of multilateralism and free trade,
China and Chile shoul d strengthen multilateral
coordination and jointly safeguard the common interests
of the Global South,"" Xi told Boric.

https://en.bd-pratidin.com/international/2025/05/14/37066 4/12Also in attendance at the China-CELAC forum was
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who arrived
in Beijing on Saturday for a five-day state visit.
Addressing delegates, Lula said his region did not ""want
to repeat history and start a new Cold War"", adding: ""Our
goal is to be an asset to the multilateral order for a global
good"".
In talks with Lula on Tuesday , Xi said the two countries
should ""strengthen cooperation"" and together ""oppose
unilateralism"", according to Chinese state media.
The United States and China have faced off in Latin
America, including over the Panama Canal, which Trump
has for months vowed to reclaim from alleged Chinese
influence.
Washington considered a Hong Kong company's
operation of ports at both ends of the interoceanic
waterway to be a threat to its national security , but Beijing
has dismissed the claims.
And China's market regulator is looking into a deal by
Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison to offload 43
ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama
Canal -- to a US-led consortium.

and as such Chinese National Day is celebrated on this date every year to commemorateBN
25/05/2025, 14:28 Scaling a new height in OBOR era | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/scaling-a-new-height-in-obor-era-1507314568 1/9the founding of People's Republic of China. Actually the Chinese Independence Day was
September 21, 1949. However, the grand ceremony was held at the Tiananmen Square on
October 1, 1949 to celebrate the forming of the Central People's Government of the country.
Later on October 2, 1949, the new government passed the 'Resolution on the National Day
of the People's Republic of China' and declared October 1 the Chinese National Day. Since
then, every October 1 has been grandly celebrated by the Chinese people. China celebrates
her National Day in many foreign countries too. Like past years, the Chinese Ambassador in
Bangladesh hosted a reception at the Embassy of China in Bangladesh on September 25
last celebrating the 68th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Bangladesh and China established diplomatic relations on October 4, 1975 and since then
the relationship has been warming year by year. Initial cooperation started between
Bangladesh Armed Forces and PLA and many Bangladeshi defence personnel were trained
in the PLA. Besides, many types of equipment of Bangladesh Armed Forces also came from
the PLA or China.  Over the years the relationship has reached almost all business and
cultural sectors, even at the strategic level, especially due to and after the historic visit of
Chinese President Xi Jinping, China's most powerful and popular leader since Deng
Xioping, the architect of China's miraculous economic growth. President Xi Jinping is also
the initiator of present China's great initiative named 'One Belt One Road', OBOR in short.
The Xi visit-described by Chinese media as a 'milestone'-was the first by any Chinese head
of state to Bangladesh in the three decades since President Li Xiannian's visit in March 1986.
It was September 15, 1988 when this scribe first landed in Beijing being one of the foreign
government scholarship students to learn Chinese language. It was between mid-1988 to
mid-1990. Since then this scribe had been visiting China regularly and had seen the
changes in the last 29 years, visited the country from Harbin in the north to Hainandao in
the south and also many cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen etc in between
and almost whole China accept three provinces. During all those visits, this scribe was
always surprised to see the continuous developments and changes.
Major factors for such successful progress of the nation were the political stability,
discipline, motivation and willingness of the people to develop the country and, of course,
the special Chinese type of leadership to take the nation ahead. The pride of the Chinese
people, ""We are Chinese and it is China and of course one China"", was the main motivation
behind all success while Communist Party of China (CPC) and Peoples Liberation Army
(PLA) provided the basic leadership, security and strength to the nation for achieving the
present glory and status.
Here the speech delivered in 1993 by General Zhang Wannian, then Chief of General Staff
(CGS) of PLA who is no more there with us at present, during his visit to Bangladesh can be
recalled. He strongly viewed the relationship between PLA and Bangladesh Armed Forces,25/05/2025, 14:28 Scaling a new height in OBOR era | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/scaling-a-new-height-in-obor-era-1507314568 2/9in particular, and Sino-Bangladesh relationship in general time-tested. Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, President Hu Jintao, Premier Li Peng, Premier Zhu Rongji and other top
ranking leaders were also heard evincing their trust and confidence on matters related to
Sino-Bangla relations. The relationship is based on long history, which now has taken the
shape of relationship of connectivity, relationship of mutual trust, confidence and inter-
dependability and the relationship of future hope as well as continuous cooperation for
mutual win-win benefits.
The historic two-day visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 14-15 2016 ushered in
a new era in Bangladesh-China relations. It was Chinese President Li Xiannian who once
and first visited Bangladesh in March 1986 when Bangladesh-China relationship got the first
direction. This time the stage was well set even before President Xi Jingping arrived. An
essay signed by President Xi was published in the national dailies in Bangladesh
highlighting the shared history of the two nations where President Xi expressed keenness
to strengthen Bangladesh-China friendship so that it can bear the ""golden fruit,"" the
prosperous future awaiting both nations. It was very clear that China wants to elevate the
bilateral relation with Bangladesh to the level of a long term strategic partnership.
Speaking before the press after a meeting with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at
her office, President Xi emphasised that the two countries are ""good friends and partners"".
""We agreed to elevate China-Bangladesh ties from a comprehensive partnership of
cooperation to a strategic partnership of cooperation,"" President Xi also said. ""We have
agreed to increase high-level exchanges and strategic communication so that our bilateral
relation would continue to move ahead at a higher level,"" The two countries also agreed
and declared 2017 the year of exchange and friendship.
Taking the advantage of the current ""golden era"" and the ongoing special as well as famous
initiative of ""One Belt One Road"", both the nations now should consider establishment of a
""Bangladesh-China Complex"" having multiple facilities. Such a complex would not only
benefit the people of Bangladesh and the Chinese people staying in Bangladesh but also
contribute to implementation of the great initiative ""One Belt One Road"".
The complex would need a larger area of land to accommodate its all requirements. There
may be a well-planned and well-organised Training Centre to train Bangladeshi employees
for Chinese companies and factories located inside Bangladesh and also in China.
According to this scribe's personal study and research, days are not very far when China
would need outside employees for their own need and Bangladesh may be their first choice
to import manpower due to our long history of exporting manpower to Middle East,
Malaysia, Italy etc. The training centre would also need the setup of a Chinese Language
Institute.25/05/2025, 14:28 Scaling a new height in OBOR era | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/scaling-a-new-height-in-obor-era-1507314568 3/9The proposed Bangladesh-China Complex would also need a separate research and
information centre, from where people would benefit themselves carrying the relationship
from the present level to a greater height. Currently there is no common place for
interactions between Bangladeshi and Chinese people located in Bangladesh. Besides,
there is no special place available in Bangladesh for the entertainment of the Chinese
people staying here in their own way. So, a special China-Bangladesh Club should also be
there inside the complex with all types of club facilities like standard accommodations,
restaurant, games, swimming, entertainment, fishing, gymnasium, library etc. The dreamed
complex may also have a commercial block to help users on communication and
commercial matters. It also can house a small-scale exhibition hall, conference or meeting
rooms etc. The complex would also include a special cultural centre displaying the heritage
of both nations for the visitors. Details may be worked out by expert persons of both the
nations, if agreed conceptually where I may also try to contribute more if required.
Bangladesh may find and offer a suitable piece of land near Dhaka while China may do the
funding under the great initiative ""One Belt One Road"". Both Bangladesh Armed Forces and
the PLA may be involved in implementation of such a big project as both have expertise in
respective areas of national development. Initial management and operation of the
complex may be left with Bangladesh Armed Forces while the subsequent management
committee may take care of its subsequent functioning. Though the project may be funded
by both governments, it may subsequently run with its own income generating club and
other facilities or activities. A similar complex may also be established in China too. 
It is assumed that such a Bangladesh-China Complex would not only benefit the ground-
level peace-loving people of Bangladesh and China but also would contribute significantly
to the overall relationship of both nations in achieving the strategic level of partnership.
Besides, the flags of cooperation and understanding between the PLA and Bangladesh
Armed Forces would also always fly high. Long live the friendship between the Bangladesh
Armed Forces and the PLA, long live Bangladesh-China relations.

Bangladesh is not willing to purchase arms under the proposed Indo Pacific Strategy
alliance, led by the United States, the foreign minister said on Monday.
Rather, he added, the country wants American investments in the country's infrastructure.
""They want to sell arms, but we are not interested in issues related to conflict,"" the minister,
AK Abdul Momen, told The FE when asked about Bangladesh's stance on the Indo Pacific
Strategy.
This message will be conveyed to the US deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegan as he
kicks off his three-day Dhaka visit on Wednesday.
Bangladesh feels that the Indo Pacific Strategy will be effective for the country if it gets US
investments in infrastructure building under it.
""We have no objection to the Indo Pacific Strategy. But they should come forward to the
infrastructure development if they want to make the Indo Pacific Strategy more effective"".
""They have to spend money, only talking will not do, they have to invest,"" the minister said
pointing out that the US has no contribution to Bangladesh's infrastructure development.
""They can do it if they want,"" he said defending his argument.
A recent move by the US to sell sophisticated defence equipment, including Apache
helicopters, could not be materialised. US officials admitted that they had several rounds ofBN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bangladesh-not-interested-in-arms-purchase-under-us-led-indo-pacific-strategy-momen-1602564695 1/6talks with the authorities concerned on selling of sophisticated US defence equipment,
which they claimed are the 'best in the world'.
According to a recent study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China
is the fifth biggest arms supplier in the world and also supplies most weapons to the region,
except India, its regional rival
Around 35 per cent of China's arms supplies went to Pakistan between 2013 and 2017,
followed by 19 per cent to Bangladesh.
Dhaka procured 71 per cent of its arms from China over the five-year period, and Myanmar
68 per cent.
In view of the growing influence of China in the region, the US and its allies launched the
Indo Pacific Strategy, apparently to counter China's Belt and Rod Initiative (BRI).
Bangladesh has already become a major partner of BRI under which it will get over US$25
billion for building infrastructure.
Recently, the USA has unleashed a fresh diplomatic offensive to revamp its ties with the
regional countries, which have become partners of the China-led BRI.
Meanwhile, the visit of the US deputy secretary of state is considered to be part of that
effort, analysts said.
Asked about possible agenda, the minister admitted that the Indo Pacific Strategy will be a
major focus in the talks between Bangladeshi officials and Mr Biegun.
However, issues related to Rohingya, visa and Covid cooperation will also come up, he
added.
""We'll discuss the Rohingya issue and we will make it clear that we are not interested in
only humanitarian assistance, our main goal is repatriation, they must go back to that
country,"" the minister said.
Dr Momen criticised the US for not issuing visas to some Bangladeshi students, who
secured I-20 from American institutions.
""They have not issued visas to Bangladeshi students who got I-20, but students of the
neighbouring countries like India and Pakistan got the same category visas. This is
discriminatory,"" he noted.
This is very discriminatory because Bangladesh's condition is better than other nations in
terms of Covid control, impact is much lesser in the country, he argued.
""Still, they did not issue visas to our students, this is not good,"" he said.
""We also want support for our garment sector, which was affected by Covid,"" the minister
said.
For example, the US can offer the garments sector three years' moratorium on duty to
enable the country to absorb shocks from Covid, he added.

Kazi Anis Ahmed, PublisherForum (WEF) in New Delhi on Thursday, reports India Today. This comes a day after the Trump
administration weighed in on India’s opposition to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor
(CPEC). India boycotted the BRI claiming it violated India’s territorial integrity, as it runs
through the disputed territory of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), leading to a compromise of
sovereignty. China's lack of transparency in the matter was also considered a factor. Foreign
Secretary Shahidul Haque stressed on the economic limitations that Bangladesh faces and
expressed the need to build links, even with China. He said: ""In case of Bangladesh, we realise
that we are geographically very small but we have, in order to overcome those limitations, to
weave ourselves with the rest of the world. That's why economic, social and political issues
remain very fundamental to our state practices irrespective of government."" ""We cannot remain
link-less in the current situation. We have to go beyond. And that's what we think would
eventually benefit us. We look at sovereignty and integration rather from a different angle,""
Shaidul Haque added. During the “Asia’s New Normal” discussion at the WEF conference, the
foreign secretary of Bangladesh emphasised on the importance of economic growth. He
mentioned that the issue of sovereignty must take a “backseat” to “economic integration,”
emphasising that the stood behind Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s decision to support the BRI.
""We can't forget what the people want and before joining BRI we had several discussions with
civil society, and it was clear, what we need is connectivity. For us as a country, what we need is
quick upgradation of our infrastructure and our generation wants much more interaction and
connectivity,"" Shahidul said. Bangladesh is attempting to balance ties with India and China,
keeping its own geo-political and economic interests in mind. “Economic issues now dictate how
much sovereignty one should exert,"" said the foreign secretary at the forum. Bangladesh formally
joined the ‘One-Belt-One Road’ initiative in 2016, which will span 65 countries with 70% of the
world’s population.

The growing strategic importance of
Bangladesh to China
Fri Apr 21, 2017 12:00 AM
Last update on: Fri Apr 21, 2017 01:05 AM
The visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Bangladesh on October 14-15, 2016
had been dubbed as a 'historical state visit' poised to be a geopolitical game
changer in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region. At the sidelines of Xi's visit,
Bangladeshi and Chinese firms signed USD 13.6 billion worth of deals in trade
and investment in addition to the USD 20 billion in loan agreements signed by the
two governments. The inevitable question is why the world's second largest
economy comprising of 1.37 billion people and an economy 67 times bigger than
Bangladesh is cozying up to the world's 47th largest economy? What geopolitical
importance does Bangladesh have to receive such enormous bilateral assistance
from a nation aspiring to be the next world leader? Bangladesh's strategically
important geographic location, physical and political proximity to India,
availability of cheap labour, and proximity to the Bay of Bengal have considerable
implications for Chinese regional geopolitics and geo-economics.
Consolidating sphere of influence in the Indian Ocean
The Chinese economy is heavily dependent on energy resources transported via
the secure sea-lanes in the Indian Ocean. Around 80 percent of China's energy
import from the Middle East pass through the Strait of Malacca, which is a
narrow stretch of water connecting the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. Malacca
provides China the shortest maritime route to Europe, Africa and Middle East.
China's ever increasing need for energy have increased the strategic importance
of this maritime region and the importance of maintaining good relations with
littoral states in and around the region. To consolidate influence in this critical
trade route and at the same time shedding overdependence on it, China has been
pledging investment to the littoral states around the Indian Ocean. It is due to this
strategy, Bangladesh, owing to its geographic positioning in the Bay of Bengal,
has been the recipient of investment pledges from China's deep pockets.
Bangladesh is an important factor in the much touted 'string of pearls' theory,
which explicates how China intends to exert more influence around the Malacca
Strait and Indian Ocean through investment in development and infrastructural
projects around Indian Ocean rim states.
To cut down over-reliance on the Strait of Malacca, China is already building oil
pipelines from the Burmese port Kyakpiu to Kunming. In this context, China is
also keen on developing the Chittagong port in the hopes of building a parallel
pipeline connecting Chittagong-Kyakpiu-Kunming. If India ever, with US support,
blocks the Malacca chokepoint through the Indian base in the Andaman Sea, it
can have dire repercussions for the Chinese manufacturing base. Hence, it is
important for China to gain more influence in the Indian Ocean region through
bankrolling infrastructural investment in the coastal nations.
Conduit to South Asia
For long, China has invested much of its attention towards South East Asia but
has now diverted towards South Asia, a region comprising of one-fourth of the
world's population and housing the third largest economy by Purchasing Power
Parity (PPP), which represents a lucrative market for Chinese products. Since
connectivity at the moment is not feasible via the contentious Arunachal Pradesh
or through Afghanistan or Pakistan, one way for China to reach mainland India is
through Bangladesh, given the friendly relation the two countries maintain. Also,
to activate the Bangladesh-China-India Myanmar (BCIM) sub-regional corridor,
crucial for reaching South Asian markets, it is imperative to bring Bangladesh on
board. China intends to draw in Bangladesh through massive infrastructural
investment, an act touted by experts as China's 'checkbook diplomacy.'
Checking India's regional dominance and market for arms
sale
China has been quietly checkmating India's regional dominance in South Asia
through its arms sale in countries bordering India. While Beijing today is the
third largest arms provider in the world, between 2011 and 2015, 71 percent of
Chinese arms exports were to Pakistan, Myanmar, and Bangladesh – states
proximate to both India and China. Although Bangladesh's USD 195 billion GDP is
a meagre 0.017 percent of China's USD 11 trillion GDP, between 2011 and 2015
Bangladesh was the second largest recipient of Chinese arms in the world with
Beijing supplying over 80 percent of the country's arms imports over the past
decade. When China sells heavy armaments like tanks and submarines to a
country, the importing country becomes reliant on China for a long time for
training, maintenance, and repair. This reliance inevitably results in certain
degree of influence on the importing country. This makes it advantageous for
China to be selling arms at low prices and on easy credit to countries bordering
India as a way of checking India's geopolitical ambitions in the region. For China,
growing ties with Bangladesh serves the dual purpose of revenue from sale of
arms and checking Indian dominance in the region.
Key player in the One Belt One Road interconnection
During the 1960s, China was hesitant in forging regional cooperation with its
Asian neighbours which changed during the 1990s after the Asian Financial
Crisis. Since President Xi Jinping has come to power, China has taken a leadership
role in forging community based regional integration in Asia. The geographical
focus of integration for China has earlier been confined only to East Asia which
has now been expanded to encompass South and Central Asia. China is currently
expanding on two fronts; westward towards Eurasia and southward towards the
Indian Ocean.  Counterbalancing USA's influence in Asia Pacific is also one of
many reasons why China is so persistently pushing for mega projects such as the
One Belt One Road (OBOR). Bangladesh is centrally situated along the BCIM
Economic Corridor and retains a strategic position along the 21st Century
Maritime Silk Road with Chittagong port as a major maritime pivot through the
Indian Ocean, a very important factor for realisation of both the Economic Belt
and Maritime Road initiatives.
Xi's 'One Belt, One Road' is his most ambitious foreign and economic policy till
date. To solidify his second term, rejuvenate a slowing China, and to assume
political leverage over its neighbors, Xi has already begun to vigorously market
this flagship project. OBOR will support China in becoming the new leader of free
trade in Asia Pacific with the US abandoning the TPP. It would also geo-
economically assist China in dealing with its excess capacity, upgrade its
industry, and develop its less prosperous regions. To materialise all
interconnections under OBOR, Xi Jinping now needs to woo former Indian allies
in South Asia to commit to his projects.
Relocating Sunset Industries
As labour costs rise in China, its declining sunset industries will be looking for
places to relocate. China will continue to move away from labour intensive low-
tech industries owing to its rising labour costs and cooling markets. It will
gradually move towards high margin and high-end manufacturing like IT,
aerospace, and telecommunication. Existing Chinese companies, producing low-
end labour intensive products will be looking for places with cheap labour to
relocate their plants. With almost a third of its population between the ages of 15-
30, Bangladesh provides a huge young workforce at one of the cheapest rates in
the world to the Chinese manufacturers of sunset industries wishing to carry
forward with many of their labour intensive industries.
From the bigger scheme of regional power play to the unexplored potential in
commerce and connectivity, Bangladesh is one of the most vital countries for
China in expanding its sphere of influence in South and Southeast Asia. Hence, it
is no surprise that the 2016 visit by President Xi Jinping, first in more than three
decades, saw China-Bangladesh relations elevated to 'Strategic Partnership of
Cooperation' from 'Comprehensive Partnership'. It is now for Bangladesh to gain
leverage from China's checkbook diplomacy while maintaining the delicate
balance of regional geopolitics.

An inter-ministerial meeting, chaired by the foreign secretary, was held at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs on Sunday to discuss Bangladesh’s agenda for a key meeting with Chinese President Xi
Jinping. 
The discussions covered political relations, trade, health, water, foreign loans, agriculture,
connectivity and energy cooperation. 
The foreign ministry is working to finalize the specific issues Bangladesh will present during the
talks.
A senior foreign ministry official said various ministries presented cooperation proposals related
to China at the inter-ministerial meeting, including a list of key projects. 
In coordination with the Chief Adviser’s Office, Bangladesh’s stance for the bilateral meeting
with President Xi will be determined, they added. 
Tentative itinerary
The chief adviser is scheduled to leave for China on March 26 to attend the Boao Forum for Asia
Conference in Hainan Province. 
On March 27, he will deliver a speech at the conference’s opening plenary session. He may also
meet with China’s Executive Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
On March 28, Chief Adviser Yunus is set to meet President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the
People in Beijing. On the same day, he will visit a high-tech enterprise under Huawei.
Additionally, a leading Chinese media outlet will conduct an interview with him.
On March 29, Peking University will confer an honorary doctorate on Professor Yunus, where he
will also deliver a speech. He is expected to return to Dhaka on the same day.

destination. 
However, due to visa complications, patients with critical illnesses are facing difficulties. 
Bangladesh has requested China to designate four hospitals in Kunming specifically for
Bangladeshi patients, ensuring a supportive treatment environment. 
The first batch of Bangladeshi patients departed for China on Monday.
Dhaka has also proposed that Beijing assist in establishing a world-class hospital in Bangladesh.
This initiative aims to provide advanced medical facilities domestically while maintaining an
option for treatment in China.
A government official said: “Whether Bangladeshis choose to seek treatment in China will
depend on their experience. The first batch of patients is crucial, as their feedback could influence
future decisions.”
The hospital project falls within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,
which is expected to take necessary initiatives.
Trade and economic collaboration
Bangladesh is exploring opportunities to establish sunset industries—industries in decline in
China—within its territory. 
This move would benefit both nations by creating jobs in Bangladesh while allowing China to
continue profiting from these industries.
Regarding agricultural cooperation, an official said: “As in many countries, the younger
generation in Bangladesh is losing interest in farming. Mechanization is essential for higher
productivity with fewer workers. China has made significant advancements in agricultural
technology, and we could seek assistance in this sector.”
The prospect of launching a direct Chittagong-Kunming flight is also under discussion, with
efforts underway to implement the plan.

The interim government must talk about jobs, industrialisation and the partnership with
China
VISUAL: ANWAR SOHEL
If Bangladesh is suspended within the geopolitical tripod of India, China and the
United States, where are we positioning now? The current discourse suggests that
priorities are set where the near-neighbour with the largest GDP on the planet
only gets bronze, not silver, and certainly not gold.
Beijing keeps its customary quiet demeanour, scrupulously keeping to its
decades-long policy of not publicly interfering in internal matters. They are,
however, quite interested in the events of the Bengal delta. The Global Times on
August 12 noted that Donald Lu's visit in May was seen by some as ""part of a
strategy to pressure Hasina into acting against China."" Liu Zongzi, director of the
Center of South Asia Studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies,
guessed that the reason for the US ""seeking to overthrow her [Hasina]"" was ""(her
non-compliance) with the US on many issues.""
Myanmar an d St Martin's Island
Let's chat about St Martin's Island, a tiny, three square-kilometre coral outpost, as
referred to in Chinese media. I visited the island—also known as Narikel Jinjira—
in 2001, staying there for a night—a time when it was still not on the tourist trail.
It took mere minutes to walk from one end to the other. Could this fragile place
really be the location for a US base, to add to their 800-plus others around the
globe? Eight kilometres off the coast of Arakan, some suggest it could be a
listening post and a forward deployment point. In the age of drones, could one
intervene in Arakan and the rest of Myanmar? It reminds us how Bangladesh and
Myanmar security forces faced off each other in 2018.

Mission to China: Is the PM ready to take a bold position
on RCEP?
Whether it is St Martin's or Teknaf is not the issue. Beijing is naturally alarmed by
the civil war in Myanmar, with which it shares a long porous border. Instability in
this resource-rich place directly affects Yunnan. Given that the US is confronting
China in the Taiwan Straits, it is plausible that a ""second front"" might appear on
the Irrawaddy (Ayeyarwady). If Dhaka shifts from Delhi to Washington's orbit with
this new administration (or possibly a BNP one), Beijing will naturally look at the
security implications across the Naf River and beyond.
In 2024, the unipolar world of yesteryear has disappeared.
China is the manufacturing core of the world. It is the largest
consumer market, too. It is just that we have little to sell to
them, hence the urgent necessity to set up newer production
lines to create higher skilled jobs.
More than a million Rohingya remain trapped in an open air confinement in
Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar. Imploring China to assist with their repatriation begs
the question: why are they going to spend enormous amounts of political capital
in dealing with the brutal Tatmadaw or the Arakan Army? Dhaka needs to
formulate a much broader policy on Myanmar, which takes into consideration
Beijing's anxieties and seeks common ground between the two. That would be a
first. Besides the Rohingya, how often have our political elites ever evinced an
interest in Myanmar—and thus China?
There was one time. In 2012, there were talks of Chinese willingness to build a
direct road from Kunming via Mandalay to Teknaf, which was shelved. India
leaned on Yangon to block that lifeline. Later, Delhi also put an end to the longer
route from Kunming to Kolkata, via Dhaka, which had been rebranded as BCIM
(Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor).

The geopolitics of Sheikh Hasina's fall explained
Treating China like a cash cow?
This is where we come to the nub of the problem. We see China as just a giant
foreign aid ATM. They are ready to lend and build as part of the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), but they also seek a deeper partnership.
Even though I had my fears, I wrote a piece in this daily in July, titled ""Mission to
China."" I was shocked how disastrous the trip to Beijing turned out to be. Last
year, in discussions in Dhaka, I was led to believe that the Awami League
government would shift dramatically to Beijing after securing its victory in the
January 7 (s)election. But would Delhi allow such a thing? This year, Sheikh
Hasina made not one, but two, visits to Delhi. The second one looked like a
dressing down by the South Block. Chinese offers to invest over a billion dollars
in saving the little water that came from the Teesta River were to be rejected. So
were any major breakthroughs. So, the former foreign minister, Hasan Mahmud,
and associates bandied about the sum of money they would ask out of China. $5
billion worth of yuan, which became $2 billion. More infrastructure—easy to
syphon commissions from, perhaps.
This was capped off by a severe breach of diplomatic protocol. Hasina and her
courtiers tore up the schedule and returned one night earlier. Mahmud claimed it
was because she was terribly ill. Even if it was because they got wind of the
seriousness of the student revolt, the then foreign minister and colleagues could
have remained. But no, they returned—all smiles. Criticisms were batted away
with a prime ministerial diagnosis that our heads had to be examined.
As a gift, China upgraded the relationship to that of a Comprehensive Strategic
Cooperative Partnership. Has anyone noticed much of any dialogue or
observations about this?
That was then, this is now
Over the last decade, we have been unable to work with China to build a new
industrial export sector to wean us away from our dangerous dependency on the
RMG sector. Jagaran Chakma's report in this daily last month detailed the painful
odyssey of the Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone. The 784-acre site in
Chattogram was allocated for Chinese industry. Intended to create as many as
200,000 jobs, it is still inoperative for eight long years.

Echoes of colonialism in Bangladesh
The interim government must talk about jobs, industrialisation and the
partnership with China. Last month, the issue, at its ultimate core, was not only
the unfair distribution of bureaucratic posts; it was also the profound lack of
decent employment in the private sector. To solve that, one needs a policy, a
strategy and shedloads of capital. Right now, only China offers that quantity of
capital and expertise to invest in new industries. Supply chains, component-
producing factories, industrial clusters are all exporting to earn dollars and yuan.
This should form the basis of the developmental discourse, and it should be
steered towards modern industry and associated technology.
In 2024, the unipolar world of yesteryear has disappeared. China is the
manufacturing core of the world. It is the largest consumer market, too. It is just
that we have little to sell to them, hence the urgent necessity to set up newer
production lines to create higher skilled jobs.
Can Md Touhid Hossain convince us that Bangladesh has not moved merely from
the Indian leg of the tripod directly to a distant Western power? I would like to
hear more about how Bangladesh will work with China, to genuinely further
mutual interests. This is still a least developed country. Tens of millions of young
Bangladeshis are rightly impatient. Time is short.

Ambassador of China to Bangladesh Yao Wen on Saturday said Bangladesh and China
""should deepen the strategic partnership"" for cooperation and explore new growth points.
""China is willing to work with Bangladesh to continue exploring cooperation opportunities
under the Global Development Initiative (GDI), Global Security Initiative (GSI) and Global
Civilization Initiative (GCI),"" he said.
In particular, the ambassador said, they are willing to promote the upgrading of industries
and the digitalization process in Bangladesh and to improve the quality and
competitiveness of “Made in Bangladesh.""
He was delivering the keynote speech at a symposium as part of the Cosmos
Dialogue Ambassadorsʼ Lecture Series entitled ""Bangladesh-China Relations: Prognosis for
the Future"" at a hotel in Dhaka.
The discussion was chaired and conducted by President of Cosmos Foundation and
renowned scholar-diplomat and former Advisor on Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh Caretaker
Government Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury.
While delivering the welcome remarks, Chairman of Cosmos Foundation Enayetullah Khan
said Bangladesh and China are moving closer together as friends on the international stage.
The ties received a major boost during the visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to China in
2019 and the watershed point of this transformation was President Xi Jinpingʼs all-
important visit to Bangladesh in 2016, he said, adding that this heralded the beginning of
the “strategic partnership”.BN

know from President Xi that the Chinese people have a dream; so do we in Bangladesh as
we strive to achieve middle-income status, of which we are on the cusp,"" Khan said.
""It is my firmest conviction that ties with China will continue to form the bedrock of our
efforts to fulfil these aspirations,"" he added.
Dr Iftekhar Chowdhury said it appears to all of them that China is rising, and the Chinese
saw this as a peaceful rise.
“Now, being even more careful, they no longer talk of ʻpeaceful riseʼ but only peaceful
development,” he said, adding that established global powers, of course, see this as a
threat.
Referring to PM Hasinaʼs visit to Beijing in 2014 and President Xiʼs visit to Bangladesh in
2016, he said these visits saw an “all-weather” friendship elevate to a strategic partnership.
Dr Iftekhar said Bangladesh-China relations are, therefore, emerging as an equation in the
diplomatic calculations in Asia that will not fully show for itself tomorrow or the day after,
but in the long run in a continent where time for many is not of the essence.
Ambassador Yao said his country has noticed the “Indo-Pacific Outlook of Bangladesh”
released recently, and believes that many of its ideas are similar to those of China.
""China supports Bangladesh in playing a more active and significant role in regional and
international affairs while preserving its foreign policy of independence,"" he said.
The world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century, and the pendulum of
prosperity is pivoting to the East, said the Chinese envoy.
""Both China and Bangladesh are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges,"" he
said.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the launching of the BRI.
Eight megaprojects in Bangladesh, such as the Padma Bridge Railway Link Project, will be
completed and put into use.
The construction of the Rajshahi Surface Water Treatment Plant Project will also kick off,
said the Ambassador, sharing the outcomes of the high-level visits in 2016 and 2019 and
deepening cooperation under the BRI.
Talking about the future of relations, Ambassador Yao said Bangladesh and China should
continue to firmly support each other in following a development path that suits our
respective national conditions.
The modernization of both China and Bangladesh involves a huge population.
""We should always bear realities in mind as we address issues, make decisions, and take
action. We should adhere to the path of peaceful development, and refuse to tread the old
path of war, colonisation, and plunder taken by some countries,"" he said.
""Standing on our own feet, both China and Bangladesh have made a miracle of rapid socio-
economic development, thus attracting the attention of the whole world,"" he added.
The envoy said China respects Bangladesh's choice of its own development path, and is
willing to strengthen strategic communication and mutual learning with Bangladesh on this
basis.
""China and Bangladesh should continue to support each other on issues of core interests,
and say ""no"" to external interference with one voice,"" he said.
Yao said Bangladesh and China should make their relations a model of friendship among
developing countries, thus making their contribution to the building of a human25/05/2025, 11:51 Dhaka, Beijing should ""deepen strategic partnership"" to explore new growth points: Ambassador Yao | The Financial Express

Vice Dean for Research, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of
Singapore, Professor Kanti Bajpai, mentioned three opportunities where Bangladesh-China
would have fruitful relationships.
He said the first one is a diplomatic opportunity to play the role of a bridging nation in
multiple ways.
Kanti Bajpai also talked about cooperation on the climate change front, in the area of
renewables, and bringing in new technologies.
Indo-Pacific Outlook
Highlighting Bangladesh's ""Indo-Pacific Outlook"" and China-Bangladesh cooperation
Senior Fellow and Secretary General of South Asia and China Center, Shanghai Institutes for
International Studies Liu Zongyi said Bangladesh released the ""Indo-Pacific Outlook"",
which formulates a blueprint for the interaction between Bangladesh and stakeholders in
the Asia-Pacific region.
“From my humble observation, the release of Bangladesh's ""Indo-Pacific Outlook"" is not
only an initiative for Bangladesh to maintain its diplomatic independence and pursue its
own national interests, but also a helpless move under constant pressure from the United
States and India to take sides,” he said.
This document of Bangladesh, like that of ASEAN, is called Outlook, which itself shows its
neutrality rather than its specific strategic implications, said the expert.
“At the same time, I also noticed that Bangladesh's Indo-Pacific Outlook is tailored to the
country's specific threat perception and strategic reality, with a focus on managing non-
traditional security issues, strengthening connectivity, and promoting economic
development and prosperity,” Liu said.
He thinks Bangladesh's choice is representative of the global South. “In order to contain
China and Russia, the United States is now engaging in global diplomacy to gain support
from developing countries, regardless of the harm the United States has done to these
countries before.”
China dislikes the term ""Indo-Pacific"" because it is a geopolitical design aimed at China
from its source around 2006, and its security implications are obvious, Liu said.
Especially in areas such as flood control and drought prevention, poverty reduction and
disaster relief, river governance, and urban river sewage treatment that Bangladesh
particularly needs, he said, Bangladesh and China can further strengthen cooperation and
exchange.
Econom ic Miracle
Appreciating Bangladeshʼs infrastructure development, Professor of Institute of
International Studies, Fudan University, China Lin Minwang said Bangladesh is on the right
path to becoming the next economic miracle in the coming decades.
Talking about Bangladeshʼs balancing foreign policy, he said, “From the Chinese side, we
are really comfortable with Bangladesh foreign policy which tries to make a balance
between the two powers in this region (China and India).”
Prof Lin said China was just seeking cooperation with Bangladesh in all areas, not just
limited to the economy.
He said international companies, including the Japanese and the US, are paying attention
to Bangladesh, and Bangladesh has more bargaining power now. “This is really beneficial
to Bangladesh.”25/05/2025, 11:51 Dhaka, Beijing should ""deepen strategic partnership"" to explore new growth points: Ambassador Yao | The Financial Express

China LI Hongmei said she is very surprised to see the rapid development of Bangladesh. “I
still see so many construction sites on the roads. I think this is a land of hope for the future.”
Highlighting geopolitical completion among the big powers, she said they are in a world of
uncertainty and turbulence.
She said the United States pays more attention to the Bay of Bengal and focuses more on
countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, which joined the BRI.
Prof Li laid emphasis on development and encouraged Bangladesh to engage with
everyone to the best
“We want development in the region,” she said, asking to join hands to realise the Dream of
Sonar Bangla and the Chinese Dream.
Former Bangladesh High Commissioner to India and former Ambassador to the United
States Tariq A Karim said history matters and laid emphasis on having respect for the
sovereignty of all nations, the principle of noninterference, respect for territorial integrity,
and a commitment to non-alignment.
“We want a good relationship with everyone,” he said, adding that China has been a partner
in helping Bangladesh in its aspirational drives.
“Our geography mixes us naturally with the bridging nation. We are a middle power with
170 million people. We want to keep developing our relations in our own way with active
and positive neutrality with every nation with whom we build friendship,” said the foreign
affairs expert.

China-Bangladesh relations_ Contemporary convergence _ The Daily Star.pdf,"China-Bangladesh relations:
Contem porary convergence
Wed Jan 25, 2012 12:00 AM
Last update on: Wed Jan 25, 2012 12:00 AM
The relationship between Bangladesh and China dates back centuries. Historical
records show that there were three Silk Roads that connected primeval China
with the Indian aubcontinent. The Southern Silk Route was a bridge between the
eastern part of Bengal (today's Bangladesh) and the Middle Kingdom. War and
other conflicts in the region, particularly during and after World War II,
disrupted the Sino-Bengal historical ties and connectivity.
However, economic rise of China in the past three decades as well as Bangladesh's
steady economic growth since the early 1990s have resulted in better trade ties
between the two nations. Further, the contemporary economic convergence in
Asia, thanks to the shifting global centre of economic gravity towards east has
created a space to re-establish their historic connectivity.
According to Dany Quah, an academic from London School of Economics, the
global centre of economic gravity that was once at a point deep in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean in the 1980s has shifted east over the past 30 years, and could
well shift even further over the next 30 years clustering around the border
between China and India. Professor Quah observed that as incomes and
populations change through time, so too does the world economic centre of
gravity shift about on Earth.
That said, the relationship between Bangladesh and China has been coined as
""time-tested, all-weather friendship."" There is a plethora of bilateral agreements
between Dhaka and Beijing including, trade, soft loans, social contacts, cultural
exchanges, academic interactions, infrastructure development and military sales.
China is the largest supplier of military hardware to Bangladesh. Here I discuss
the current state as well as emerging trends in Sino-Bangladesh relations --
focusing on trade, investment, infrastructure and connectivity. The key
challenges -- regional geo-politics as well as Bangladesh's internal political
dynamics -- to further strengthening the ties between the two nations are also
highlighted.
Both China and Bangladesh witnessed marked increase in trade in recent
decades: China's Trade-to-GDP ratio has exceeded 55% and that of Bangladesh's
approaches 50%. China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner, with total trade
exceeding $7 billion in 2010. However, the former remains a minor export
destination for the latter. Beijing has offered duty-free access to 4,721 Bangladeshi
products to address the growing trade imbalance.
Nevertheless, massive structural shift in the Chinese economy is creating huge
opportunities for Bangladesh. Beijing is increasingly focusing on the
development of high-end manufacturing and services. This is largely due to the
rising wage cost in the coastal regions of China and appreciation of its currency.
Moreover, following the recent financial crisis, there is a realisation that the
country's current growth model that relies excessively on exports and investment
needs to be rebalanced, with a greater emphasis on consumption. Development
of high-end manufacturing and service sectors is the key in this regard.
China's move towards a vertical economy has already created much room for
Bangladesh, owing to its abundant supply of labour. In fact, Bangladesh is fast
approaching Asia's apparel hub, and a recent Mckinzey report indicates that the
country's RMG exports will double by 2015 and nearly triple within a decade.
With Bangladesh's more favourable demographic transition in hand, more
complementarities could also emerge in the medium term owning to contrast in
China's ageing and other demographic disadvantages.
While Beijing is offering some privileges to export Bangladeshi products to China,
it shows significant promise to eventually become an ultra market for
Bangladeshi products, particularly RMG, given its sheer size. This coincides with
projected relative economic decline of Europe and the United States, Bangladesh's
traditional export markets.
As far foreign direct investment (FDI) is concerned, China has become an
important source of outward FDI in Asia and Africa, even in the West. There is
also a significant Chinese investment in Bangladesh. But the scale can be much
higher than the existing level. In fact, according to the Board of Investment, a
record 219 foreign investment projects registered with it in 2011, including a large
number from China.
The next critical issue with regard to Sino-Bangladesh relations is connectivity.
China's economic growth has resulted in regional inequalities within the country.
While coastal areas have witnessed spectacular increase in living standard, the
hinterlands are relatively less developed. To bridge the gap between the
hinterlands, particularly landlocked south-western China, and the coastal
regions, Beijing is making huge investments.
Being landlocked, the Yunnan province of China seeks greater economic
engagement with Bangladesh including access to the Bay of Bengal. Both Beijing
and Dhaka have been negotiating a number of mega infrastructure projects,
notably highway and railway networks, connecting Chittagong and Kunming
through Myanmar. While Yunnan has a ready infrastructure and the Myanmar
part of the project is being built, Dhaka has to act fast to connect with the
network. China also wants to develop a deep-sea port in Chittagong.
If the plan is eventually materialised, the Chittagong-Mandalay-Kunming
highway offers another opportunity for Bangladesh in the Mekong sub-region
(GMS), consisting of Cambodia, China (Yunnan and Guangxi Zhuang), Lao PDR,
Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. The GMS is a natural economic area bound
together by the Mekong River, covering 2.6 million square kilometers, and a
combined population of around 326 million. China, Asean and Asian
Development Bank (ADB) are spending big to develop infrastructure in the
region. According to ADB, priority infrastructure projects in the region worth
around $10 billion have either been completed or are being implemented.
While the infrastructure projects that aim to connect Bangladesh with south-
western China, Myanmar and other GMS regions make much economic sense,
geopolitics is a hurdle to connecting the dots between Bangladesh and China.
Bangladesh, which is sandwiched between two rising giants China and India, has
to address some geopolitical issues aligning with its long term interest. Beijing's
massive infrastructure spending, particularly sea port development in South Asia
and elsewhere in the world, has been seen, notably by its arch rivals India and
United States,, as part of the Middle Kingdom's ""String of Pearl Strategy,"" a
manifestation of China's rising geopolitical influence through efforts to increase
access to ports and airfields, develop special diplomatic relationships and
modernise military forces, inter alia.
Nonetheless, owing to the highly polarised politics in Bangladesh, the two key
political parties' skewed relationship with Beijing and New Delhi has been a
barrier for the country to augment its physical connectivity with its South and
East Asian neighbours. However, as discussed, economic dynamism in East and
Southeast Asia, economic convergence in Asia and Bangladesh's aspiration for
higher economic growth indicate that economic forces could triumph over
geopolitics in the near future.
To sum-up, while trade volume between China and Bangladesh continues to
increase thanks to the latter's steady economic growth and the former's
diversified exports basket, China's structural shift could rectify the Sino-
Bangladesh trade imbalance to some extent. In fact, trade between Bangladesh
and other Southeast and East Asian economies is also on the rise. So is the
investment trend. However, when it comes to connectivity and infrastructure
development, the state has to play a big role balancing the country's economic
imperatives and geopolitical risks. Given the massive economic changes that are
taking place in East Asia, centring China, Bangladesh should adopt to a de facto
""Look East Policy"" to bring itself closer to the new global centre of economic
gravity.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/134781/opportunities-abound-in-the-chinese-belt-road 1/5a-decade 19th Party Congress, underlines the importance of BRI for President Xi Jinping
personally and his growing desire for China to take a global leadership role. It can also be argued
that the increasingly inward-looking United States, under President Trump, has left a global
leadership vacuum that China’s President Xi Jinping has been keen to fill. And BRI will be
instrumental in that respect. So what is BRI, how is it expected to evolve, and how best should
Bangladesh engage? In October 2017, two of China’s leading think-tanks -- the China Institutes
of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) and Anbound, -- hosted a delegation of three
leading Bangladesh think-tanks led by Ambassador Farooq Sobhan -- Bangladesh Enterprise
Institute (BEI), the Policy Research Institute (PRI), and Bangladesh Institute International
Strategic Studies (BIISS) – along with the Bangladesh Bank's Chief Economist Faisal Ahmed, the
BGMEA, as well as this author. The two days of seminars gave the participants time to explore
the BRI concept and the future of China-Bangladesh relations. But before discussing BRI with
respect to Bangladesh, it is worth giving some background to the project.
A bit of backgr ound
BRI was officially launched in September 2013 when President Xi used a speech at a university
in Kazakhstan to call for the creation of a “Silk Road Economic Belt.” The project was later
expanded and re-branded with its current name. The Belt and Road initiative has two main
prongs: One is called the “Silk Road Economic Belt” (the belt) and the other the “21st Century
Maritime Silk Road” (the road). The economic importance of BRI for China is driven by the
transition phase it is currently going through. With the economy slowing from the 10% GDP
growth rate seen for the past three decades to a “New Normal” of 6-7%, there is an imperative to
move away from domestic infrastructure and traditional Western export markets and open up and
create new markets for Chinese goods and technology. One might also argue that China will
benefit from exporting excess cement and steel capacity by shifting factories overseas to less
developed countries. Beijing also hopes Xi’s initiative will help boost the economies of less
developed border regions such as Xinjiang by linking them with neighbouring countries. But
many believe that BRI is also a geopolitical initiative to boost China’s regional importance at a
time when Donald Trump’s US looks to be stepping back from Asia.
BRI and Bangladesh
So what does BRI mean for Bangladesh? Well the immediate focus has been large scale
infrastructure investment that was catalysed by the historic visit of Chinese president Xi Jinping
to Bangladesh in October 2016 when he committed to $40 billion of investment and aid. Of the
27 agreements on development, collaboration, and financial assistance/loans, highlights included
Karnaphuli Multi-Lane Tunnel project in Chittagong, the Confucius Institute at Dhaka University,
and the Tier-4 National Data Centre in Gazipur’s Kaliakoir, Shahjalal Fertiliser Company Limited

fired power plant in Chittagong’s Banshkhali.
Opportunities for Bangladesh in the BRI Initiative Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) were
also signed for cooperation, maritime cooperation, joint feasibility study on a free-trade area, new
ICT framework, counter-terrorism collaboration, capacity building and sharing of information,
tackling climate change risks, regional and international cooperation, and cooperation on power
and energy sectors. But Bangladesh should see BRI as offering much more opportunity than just
tackling our infrastructure deficit, important though that is. An excellent reference and resource
for seeing the larger opportunities is to look at the “Visions and Actions” white paper published
by the Chinese government in 2015. It makes clear that BRI was always intended to be a broader
vision from the outset, and not simply an infrastructure connectivity program. The report
highlights five “pillars” of BRI: 1) Policy Coordination; 2) Facilities Connectivity; 3) Unimpeded
Trade; 4) Financial Integration; and 5) People-to-People Bonds. BRI regional connectivity for
Bangladesh is focused on an extension of the BCIM (Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar)
economic corridor, or what began as the Kunming initiative, proposed by Professor Rehman
Sobhan as far back as 1999. However, the Indian opposition to BRI has been evident with
suspicions about the geopolitical ambitions of China in South Asia, as well as sensitivity about
CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) running through disputed Kashmir. More recently,
the Rohingya crisis has soured Bangladesh-Myanmar relations, posing another problem for the
initiative, particularly for physical connectivity, since Bangladesh does not share a common
border with China and hence is reliant on transit via either India or Myanmar. Hopefully, over
time, India will find that the economic benefits of better relations with China -- given that the

https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/134781/opportunities-abound-in-the-chinese-belt-road 3/5latter will soon become the largest economy in the world – outweighs other considerations.
Similarly, Myanmar’s economic progress will be reliant on greater global integration, which only
seems possible once a solution to the Rohingya crisis that is acceptable to both countries, and the
refugees themselves, is found. However, looking at pillars 3) and 4) of the “Visions and Actions”
China White paper, I believe we should accelerate the development of a “Twin Trade and
Financial Corridor “between Bangladesh and China. Regarding trade, while China has become
our largest trading partner accounting for 26% of imports, we also have a $10.9 bn trade deficit
with them. The imbalance is somewhat exaggerated by the fact that imports from China are
dominated by industrial machinery and raw materials needed for Bangladesh’s RMG export
sector, which has grown to be the second largest in the world. Nonetheless there remains
substantial scope for expanding our exports to China itself, which is already the largest consumer
sector in Asia.
Leveraging BRI
The rapid growth of the spending power in China offers a significant opportunity for Chinese
companies to invest here. With the development of dedicated economic zones, Bangladesh is
becoming an attractive investment destination as a low-cost re-export hub to the huge Chinese
domestic market as well as to neighbouring India and ASEAN countries, and with duty free
access to the EU. A second major opportunity is to establish a financial corridor. Physical
infrastructure is key but financial sector and capital markets infrastructure development is also
important. In this context, it is worth noting that China now has the second largest equity and
third largest bond markets in the world. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have a
combined market capitalisation of around $8 trillion and more than 100 million retail investors.
So beyond FDI, Bangladesh can benefit in the future under BRI from greater financial integration
that may see more Chinese portfolio investment in the Bangladesh stock market. At the moment,
China’s capital account is not fully liberalised, so retail investors there cannot invest in
Bangladesh directly. But there is scope through the Stock Connect link to Hong Kong listed funds
and thereby to Bangladesh. Secondly, Chinese exchanges have developed a unique venture
capital (VC) ecosystem to encourage innovation and risk capital access to technology firms. They
are then encouraged to issue IPO and list on the exchanges. This model could be introduced to
Bangladesh and support the government’s target of $5bn in ICT exports. Note that in 2017,
Chinese E-commerce firm Alibaba and social media/messaging giant Tencent were worth more
than their US counterparts Amazon and Facebook. Another major opportunity is for China-
Bangladesh joint venture companies in infrastructure, as well as technology, to have dual listings
on both Chinese and Bangladeshi stock exchanges. They could even issue RMB-denominated
Panda Bonds to access the huge pool of Chinese liquidity to finance Bangladeshi investment
projects. In conclusion, BRI offers major opportunities beyond being a source of large-scale

Deb t reschedu ling, import credit from China crucial to Bangladesh

 For all latest news, follow The Financial Express Google News channel.
Leading economists and foreign relations experts on Monday stressed the need for debt
rescheduling by the Chinese side with raising the loan repayment and grace period to
enable Bangladesh to absorb the economic shock.
Addressing an international seminar on “Bangladesh-China Relations: A Future Outlook” in
Dhaka city, they also opined that if China provide credit arrangements to Bangladesh for its
imports from that country, it will help the country address the fragile balance of payment
situation.
The Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) and the Centre for
China Studies (SIIS-DU) jointly organised the seminar to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Bangladesh.
Md Touhid Hossain, Adviser for Foreign Affairs, was the chief guest in the seminar, which
was also addressed by Mr Yao Wen, Ambassador of China to Bangladesh, and Dr Debapriya
Bhattacharya, Distinguished Fellow, CPD and Chair, Committee on White Paper on the State
of Bangladeshʼs Economy.
“Almost a quarter of our imports are coming from China, but the trade deficit is increasing.
The trade deficit is increasing at a faster rate than the volume of trade itself. China has been
generous by providing us, first, the 97 per cent duty-free and quota-free market access.
Now it has gone up to 100 per cent, but we know by now in the world, trade does not
depend on only market access based on tariffs and other financial considerations. It also
depends on the process through which trade happens. It also depends on the non-trade
barriers which are there,” Dr Debapriya said, adding, “So I think if you look at the future ofBN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/debt-rescheduling-import-credit-from-china-crucial-to-bangladesh-economy-experts 1/7Bangladesh exports to China, then it is not tariffs, it is the non-tariff barriers which we need
to look at”.
Highlighting the need for restructuring Bangladesh's debt to China, he said, “As I
mentioned, almost 9 per cent to 10 per cent of the financial flows are coming from China.
And well, if you look at the debt situation of Bangladesh at this moment, almost 5.6 billion
dollars are owed to China, which is almost 10 per cent of the country's total overseas debt.
So debt repayment is becoming an increasing challenge for Bangladesh”
“And if you look at the Chinese loans which has come in, some of them have come as
suppliers' credit. And if you see the shorter repayment period, shorter grace period, and
higher commitment charges than others, you will immediately find out there are
opportunities for streamlining them in the future” he said, noting that Chinese loan and
Chinese debt in Bangladesh definitely demands a bit more closer look.
He suggested making the debt situation more compatible with Bangladesh's upcoming
development requirements.
Mr Debapriya also observed that although foreign exchange reserves have improved in
recent weeks, and foreign exchange flows have been quite sustainable in the recent past, a
debt rescheduling is not totally out of the picture.
“At this moment, a debt rescheduling issue may soon come up to look at how we really pay
back some of these loans which are really maturing very fast” he added.
About the importance of more Chinese investment in Bangladesh, he said China could
integrate Bangladesh into the regional value chain through investments in the garments
and manufacturing sectors.
What is becoming important now is to have more Chinese investment more in Bangladesh,
particularly in the Chinese economic and industrial zone allocated in Anwara upazila on
Chittagong, he said. He also argued that more investment in the Anwara EPZ is needed to
make the Karanafuli Tunnel economically viable.
On the need for Chinese credit to support Bangladeshʼs imports from China, he said,
“Imports from China are critical for Bangladesh, and given that we do not have adequate
foreign exchange now to pay up our debt, it is important to get a financing from China in
order to underwrite those imports.”
“It is the old-fashioned open general license system that you open up a credit line which
can only go to finance the imports which are coming from China and support that one and
create no less pressure on our balance of payment situation”,  he added.
“China remains one of the single largest providers of financial support to Bangladesh last
year, 2023, for which we have the latest data that shows we received nearly $4 billion US
dollar almost in financial support, which is about 9 per cent of the total flow to Bangladesh
that year”, he told the seminar.
“We import almost $25 billion of goods from China. It is about 23 per cent of the total
imports coming to Bangladesh, and Chinaʼs investment in Bangladesh has now reached
almost $1.5 billion.”
“And what we see is important also in terms of human development. There are 20,000
Bangladeshi students studying in China at this very moment. So if this is one of the
benchmarks and if you look at the future, why should Bangladesh be looking at China as its
major source of development and economic cooperation in the future”,  he added.
Highlighting the strength of China, he said, “China, as you may know, remains a driver of
the global economy at this moment: at least 30 per cent of the global goods is attributable
to China. We joke that if China catches cold, then the whole world sneezes. That is the
economic situation what we have now. So we are talking about a country which has
generated $600 billion of trade surplus. We are talking about a country which has $3000
billion in foreign exchange reserves”.25/05/2025, 15:20 Debt rescheduling, import credit from China crucial to Bangladesh economy: Experts | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/debt-rescheduling-import-credit-from-china-crucial-to-bangladesh-economy-experts 2/7Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain said Bangladesh could not capitalise on the duty-free
access granted by China for various reasons.
“I would say that itʼs basically our lack of competitiveness in many areas and lack of
diversification. I think we need to concentrate on these two factors. We need to enhance
our competitiveness,” he said.
He agreed with the need for debt rescheduling by China.
The adviser also said Bangladesh and China have very important defense cooperation.
“As we all know, China is a major supplier of our defense equipment and the modernisation
of our military services that we are looking forward to. I think we need a lot of cooperation
in this respect, from China,” he added.
About the collaboration in infrastructure development, he said, “Of course, there are some
limitations, as has already been mentioned, and we need to overcome those so that the
infrastructure development cooperation that exists between our two countries becomes
more useful, more sustainable”.
“We also need enhanced cooperation in the energy sector, both in green and traditional
projects that are ongoing in various areas, and we hope that these will be expedited and
completed in time and become more useful for the Bangladesh economy,” he said.
Seeking Chinese cooperation in resolving the Rohingya crisis, he said, China has been
cooperating with us in facilitating the return of Rohingya.
“We know that there is only one solution to this problem that people who are now in the
camps in Bangladesh have to go back to their homeland. That is the only solution”.
“China has been with us, and there were trilateral dialogues, but unfortunately, previous
initiatives have not resulted in any return of the Rohingya to their homeland”, he said.
“I would suggest that we all know that China has a lot of influence in Myanmar, now let us
accept the reality, and we would look forward to more active Chinese role in ensuring that
we can send back these people who are in a very deplorable situation. Their rights have
been trampled upon, and they should be allowed to go back with rights and security so that
we can get over this problem once and for all, and it is not repeated one again and again,”
the foreign adviser opined.
He said, both countries, from the very beginning, have supported each other on matters of
core interest and worked together on a path to realising their respective development
goals.
“Now in the current situation, as Bangladesh has witnessed the most significant political
change in its history, the future of Bangladesh in a post revolution setting requires a more
comprehensive approach,” he said.
He added that the post-revolution trajectory of Bangladesh and its future relations with
China will likely be influenced by various factors, including Bangladeshʼs political stability
and the changing dynamics of regional and global politics.
“Although the future of bilateral ties between Bangladesh and China can be shaped by
several factors, the core elements of cooperation in the aspects of trade and investment,
infrastructure development, technology sharing are propelled by mutual interests in
economic investment and regional stability in the coming days,” he added.
Ambassador AFM Gousal Azam Sarker, Chairman, BISS presided over the seminar, where
Major General Iftekhar Anis, Director General, BIISS, delivered the welcome address.

Update : 23 Mar 2025, 12:20 PM
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing for Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus’ upcoming
visit to China, emphasizing its significance in strengthening bilateral relations.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/377002/dhaka-eyes-balance-alongside-bilateral-ties-with 1/4At the same time, the interim government remains cautious about maintaining a balanced foreign
policy among major global powers, ensuring that deepening ties with Beijing does not send the
wrong signal to others.
A foreign ministry official noted: ""China is crucial for Bangladesh in terms of politics, trade, and
development cooperation. At the same time, maintaining strong ties with China also serves as a
message to other nations.""
Another official highlighted that Bangladesh carefully considers China’s position in regional and
global geopolitics while assessing potential reactions from other global and regional powers.
""Bangladesh has strategic sovereignty — the sovereign right to make strategic decisions.
However, it is equally important to communicate with other nations and clarify why we are
engaging with China in this context,"" the official added.
Strategic sover eignty in for eign policy
Every country shapes its foreign policy based on national interests, and strategic sovereignty
refers to a nation’s independent decision-making power in this regard.
A foreign ministry official cited Bangladesh’s voting decision at the United Nations regarding the
Ukraine-Russia war as an example.
""The US and Europe proposed two separate UN resolutions to end the war. Bangladesh voted in
favour of the US-led resolution but abstained from the European one. This was a strategic
decision,"" he explained.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/377002/dhaka-eyes-balance-alongside-bilateral-ties-with 2/4He added: ""However, we also clarified our position to the European nations, explaining the
reasoning behind our decision.""
Another official said that Bangladesh might engage in discussions with other global powers that
have a vested interest in the chief adviser’s China visit.
""Our foreign policy always seeks balance. However, in diplomacy, balance does not always mean
an equal 50-50 approach. It can sometimes lean 60-40, depending on the circumstances—just as
we saw with the UN resolutions,"" he explained.
China’ s Global Development Initiative
Chinese President Xi Jinping has introduced three global initiatives — the Global Development
Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), and the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI).
China first introduced the Global Development Initiative to Bangladesh in 2022, and it is
expected to be a key topic during the chief adviser’s visit.
An official noted: ""We are evaluating this initiative carefully. Sometimes, while the text of an
agreement may seem appropriate, the broader geopolitical context may not align with our
national interests. We will make a decision after considering all aspects.""
Boao forum and potential agr eements
The chief adviser has been invited to attend the Boao Forum for Asia Conference in Hainan
Province, China, from March 25-28.
Initially, Bangladesh had not confirmed participation, but the decision to attend was finalized
after securing a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Sources indicate that if both sides reach an agreement, several bilateral deals could be signed
during the visit.

Bangladesh_s Foreign Policy Challenge _ Foreign policy quandary for Bangladesh_ ‘Umbilical’ or ‘geopolitical’_.pdf,"Bangladesh on the World Stage
Foreign policy quandary for Bangladesh:
ʻUmbilical’ or ʻgeopolitical’?
Thu Feb 15, 2024 12:00 AM
Last update on: Thu Feb 15, 2024 04:51 PM
Bangladesh's foreign inclinations increasingly sway between ""umbilical"" and
""geopolitical"" poles, as principles, policies and preferences compete for priority.
Their triggers become ""umbilical"" if, for example, they drove the country's
independence (the country's first four principles) or reflect values (joining the
Furious Cold War vibes greeted Bangladesh’s birth. PHOTO: COLLECTED
Muslim ummah); or embrace ""geopolitics"" if they rebound off regional/global
power contests. Whether ""internal"" or ""external"", only with experience can these
catalysers thrive. How, then, has Bangladesh jostled between them over 52 years?
Tussling territory: Swaying over the Bay
Even embryonic Bangladesh faced both power rivalry and economic
developmental pressures. ""Geopolitics"" riddled the Bay of Bengal during
December 1971, when Task Force 74 (TF74) was redeployed by the US Seventh
Fleet to monitor Soviet ships (it was first invoked in 1944 to mobilise what became
today's AUKUS group: Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States). Both
fleet s carried guided and gun destroyers, and included a nuclear-fitted
submarine. They were not there because China left the Soviet camp and joined
the United States, but today the Bay is monitored in case China's competition with
the United States may flare up. Whereas China's Belt Road Initiative (BRI) links
Asia with Africa and Europe over land and sea seeking regional integration, trade,
and growth, the United States has at least two fronts: the Indo-Pacific Strategy
(IPS), targeting peace, stability, and deterrence in a free and open but militarily
secured Indo-Pacific, and its Indo-Pacific Economic Forum (IPEF) promoting fair
trade but probing security-laden supply-chains, infrastructure, and clean energy
and de-carbonisation.
Furious Cold War vibes greeted Bangladesh's birth. From an Atlantic/European
platform highlighted by creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
in 1949, the ""West's"" outward spread produced the South East Asian Treaty
Organization (SEATO) and Baghdad Pact in 1955 (the latter becoming the Central
Treaty Organization, or CENTO in 1959). Both Indian and Pacific oceans fell
within the Seventh Fleet jurisdiction, just as establishing its Indian Ocean base in
Diego Garcia complicated Bangladesh's neighbourhood early in the 1970s.
""Eastern"" Cold War interests tip-toed the ""Western"". The Soviet Union's ""20-year
friendship treaty"" with China in April 1950 was institutionalised through the
Warsaw Pact in 1955, before being extended to India in August 1971
(compromising India's non-alignment identity). Tensions prevailed on another
front. China-Soviet skirmishes over the Ussuri River in 1969 allowed US National
Security Advisor Henry Kissinger the opportunity to divide communism. Using
""ping-pong"" diplomacy from April 1971, this German-born, realpolitik-laced
statesman cuddled China so much as to camouflage Bangladesh's plight.
Complementing the ""carrot"" of Soviet ""20-year friendship treaties"" was a Soviet
""stick"". This was the Brezhnev Doctrine, formulated to thwart Czech dissidents in
1968, it infam ously justified Afghanistan's invasion in 1978. Bangladesh's
""umbilical"" urgencies (consequences of 1970 cyclone, utter poverty, famine, and
war destruction), left it as only a ""geopolitics"" spectator.
Winds of change
Three change-agents threatened Bangladesh's ""umbilical"" credentials, that is, the
four founding principles (democracy, nationalism, secularity, and socialism, in
alphabetical order). The most dramatic of them assassinated Founding Father,
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in August 1975. A volte farce of loyalty
followed: democracy was nipped by 15-odd years of military intervention;
nationalism became more rhetorical than functional (for reasons discussed
below); secularity was replaced, through Article 2A of the June 1978
Bangladesh’s foreign inclinations increasingly sway between ʻumbilical’ and ʻgeopolitical’ poles. VISUAL: TEENI AND TUNI
constitutional amendment, by an ""Islamic republic"" (to be restored, alongside
Islam, as a constitutional tenet by the Supreme Court in 2010); and socialism was
swallowed by two independent and community-based change-agents.
Both change-agents carried multilateral or international dimensions. One was
microfinance. Its seeds were sown, not in metropolitans, where modern change-
agents typically begin, but across a sprawling countryside supplying four-fifths of
both the country's population and export income (through jute). Whereas famine
gripped male-dominated farming, women emerged as change-harbingers.
Microfinance made them socioeconomic catalysers due to the contributions of
Fazle Hasan Abed and Muhammad Yunus.
The other change-agent reflected a World Bank worry independently solved by
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The worry: how could jute
exports of the world's first ""basket-case"" country be salvaged from plastic? The
unwitting solution: the 1974 Multi Fiber Agreement (MFA), a measure helping less
developed countries expand RMG (ready-made garment) exports to developed
countries by temporarily suspending tariffs. South Korea lost those quotas after
acquiring a Newly Industrialising Country status, but to stabilise the economy
against rampant petroleum price-hikes and a global recession in the mid-1970s, it
had to relocate RMG production to lower-than-low-waged Bangladesh. This began
with 130 Desh Garments personnel being trained by Daewoo Corporation under
the 1978 Bangladesh-South Korea agreement. It produced Bangladesh's RMG
pioneers. Their legendary narratives entered our folklore.
Even as Bangladesh stood out across South Asia for social reforms and women empowerment, India’s pivotal Look East (now
Act East) policy orientation gave it an economic push in the Southeast Asian direction.
Once a quid pro quo consideration in global rivalry during the 1970s, the Bay now demands sine qua non attention.
Ripple-effects were huge. From the ground-floor of global economic
development, Bangladesh climbed into the top-35 largest economy over as many
years, though attracting international attention also meant pecking the brewing
China-US rivalry. Similarly, microfinance breakthroughs allowed Bangladesh to
produce some of the world's largest non-governmental organisations (NGOs), like
BRAC, Grameen Bank, and the Association for Social Advancement, while also
turning into a Bangladeshi export, especially to African countries. Spiralling RMG
exports still dominate total exports 50-odd years down the line. Even as
Bangladesh stood out across South Asia for social reforms and women
empowerment, India's pivotal Look East (now Act East) policy orientation gave it
an economic push in the Southeast Asian direction. Countries in this region
satisfactorily complement Bangladesh's industrial diversification needs. Many of
Bangladesh's FTA (free-trade agreements) negotiations today are with them,
demonstrating how principles, policies, and preferences, like humans, can and
must change with time and tide.
Privatisation, diversification, and democratisation shifted Bangladesh from a
""frontier"" country into an ""emerging market"" en route to becoming what the
government's Vision 2041 single-mindedly targets: a ""developed"" country. Yet, as a
new Cold War replaces the old, two Bay-based ""umbilical"" traits fan ""geopolitical""
flames: China replaced India as Bangladesh's largest trading partner; and the
hitherto localised China-India conflict now nurtures strategic tentacles.
Back to the Bay
Once a quid pro quo consideration in global rivalry during the 1970s, the Bay now
demands sine qua non attention, reviving Bangladesh's ""geopolitical"" ghost. Once
the Seventh US Fleet and Soviet ships squared off for only military reasons.
Against the slow conversion of an unfolding economic competition into zero-sum
military posturing, Chinese and US presence may be asking Bangladesh a million-
dollar question: will ""geopolitics"" tip the ""umbilical""? Indeed, can China's BRI
alignments and chronologically triggered QUAD/IPS/AUKUS tidal waves be
neutered? Complicating matters is the corroding but still infectious World War II
Bretton Woods system. It once miraculously revived Atlantic and European areas
alone. Can it outdo the China-based, BRI-anchored Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) and the BRICS Plus's New Development Bank (NDB) to
uplift African, Asian, and Latin American countries?
Withstanding ""geopolitical"" thrusts is painful. New threats, like climate-change,
demographic reverberations, and relentless migratory/refugee flows, deepen the
wounds. With the ""West"", Far East Asia countries, and Russia fighting
With the ʻWest’, Far East Asia countries, and Russia fighting demographic dangers, South Asia’s corresponding statistics
elevate India and Bangladesh. VISUAL: STAR
demographic dangers, South Asia's corresponding statistics elevate India and
Bangladesh. Will the Atlantic area yield to the Indo-Pacific demographically?
Indeed, could the Bay of Bengal become a potential military Achilles Heel like the
English Channel of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, or the Bosporus during the
Cold War, or perhaps how the Gaza War may displace the 20th Century Suez Canal
for a new 21st Century Rubicon? Bangladesh could be drawn in by any of the
three ignited fissures, between: (a) China and the ""West""; (b) BRICS Plus and the
""West""; and (c) the global ""North"" versus the ""South""?
Bangladesh's ""umbilical"" cords (interests/instincts) did not tangle with 1970s
""geopolitics"". Identifying with the non-alignment movement (NAM) and the
Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) was natural when the 1974 New
International Economic Order (NIEO) divided the ""North"" from the ""South"" (like
the Cold War split the ""East"" from the ""West""). Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman answered that question in the country's maiden UN General Assembly
appearance on September 25, 1974 (""friendship to all, malice to none"", a passage
included as the 14th Paragraph of the UN ""International Year of Dialogue as a
Guarantor of Peace, 2023"" Resolution by 70 countries). As we have learned,
fortifying that foreign policy foundation stone produced enormous economic
success.
NIEO and UN membership apart, 1974 epitomises other Bangladeshi futures: in
the February 1974 Lahore OIC Summit, Pakistan recognised Bangladesh; new
Middle East friends were made; and as unofficial migrant-flows became more
official, creating the Bureau for Manpower, Employment, and Training in 1976,
opening another huge foreign exchange window.
These and stellar microfinance and RMG successes prompted the UN Economic
and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 2021 to lift a ""basket-case"" Bangladesh from
""development's"" ground-floor into the ""developing"" bracket from November 2026.
Economic genes mapped the country's future, not the military, lessening
""geopolitical"" thrusts over the ""umbilical"" against the ""geopolitical"" instinct of
""survival of the fittest"". With current military expenditures of just over one
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), and a military force ranked 40th (out
of 145 countries) in the Global Firepower (GFP) 2023 Military Strength,
Bangladesh hardly qualifies as a ""geopolitical"" flag-bearer. Yet the GFP's ""Powers
on the Rise"" ranks Bangladesh as high as 12th today. It doubled military
personnel in the 1970s, but only because of military rule. Since 2013, in fact,
military strength rose in ""umbilical"" speed, from 220,000 to barely 227,000 today.
""Umbilical"" virtues matter most against economic clashes. ""Western
development"", to exemplify, is well known for ""aid on strings"". Both the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) from 1964 and the
1970s NIEO in 1974 emerged to articulate and defuse the ""string"" effects of US and
World Bank aid. Even more recently, the World Bank's refusal to build the Padma
Bridge in 2013 exposed contrasting mindsets clashing: ""Southern"" responses were
""umbilical"", yet when China took over Padma Bridge construction, ""Western""
responses took on a ""geopolitical"" look (any Chinese initiative prompts this).
China may claim ""string""-free aid, but its interest rates on loans more than double
the World Bank's (5 percent v. 2 percent). Pricier economic development invites
""geopolitical"" fingerprints, then footprints.
In the new Cold War, IPS/IPEC tiptoes China's actions much like the Soviet Union
did ""Western"" moves during the old Cold War. Evolving 2003/2004/2005 tsunami
relief efforts meshed with converging regional naval interests to produce the
Quadrilateral Dialogue in 2007. Japan's Prime Minister Shinto Abe launched it.
This was given a cultural bent when the September 2021 AUKUS Pact entwined
Anglo-Saxon countries ""geopolitically"". Port-building construction in the Bay
could inflame those simmering Indo-Pacific policies. India is building Sittwe in
Myanmar; Japan Yangon in Myanmar and Matarbari in Bangladesh; and China's
BRI's in Kyaukpyu, Myanmar; and Sonadip and Payra, Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina
visited Washington in May 2023 to celebrate 50-years of World Bank partnership,
in essence recalling the World Bank to push the Vision 2041 road to a ""developed
country"" (and thereby diversifying the RMG industry). US entry only thickens the
""geopolitical"" flavour.
Collective action is key. ""Umbilical"" loyalties promise more, with greater security,
stability, and predictability. On the other hand, ""geopolitics"" is costlier, but
perceptual gains obscure them.  
Bangladesh's half-century experiences resemble human life. As a child or
adolescent, ""umbilical"" links steadied the feet and bestowed identity; but a still
unfinished adulthood attracts adventures driven by ""geopolitical"" seduction or
necessity. How these evolve and the depth they plunge to depend upon how
viable collective youthful actions remain during adulthood.
That is one part of the jigsaw. Another involves network intricacies. Whether
Bangladesh should join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or
not, for instance, may ultimately be answered in relative terms, that is, by how
strong the relationship with one or more of the following may be at any given
point: Act East, BRICS, NAM, NIEO, and so forth.
Sturdier ""umbilical"" linkages soften ""geopolitical"" plunges, while profitable
""geopolitical"" links further strengthen ""umbilical"" loyalties. Navigating adroitly
between these inevitable but varied foreign policy directions rests upon how
skilfully we juggle our ""umbilical"" ideals and ""geopolitical"" realpolitik.

countries, fully tap the potentials of cooperation in various areas, work on “the Belt

Apart from the Belt and Road Initiative, the two sides signed documents of
cooperation in areas of industrial capacity building, power and energy , information
and communication technology , investment, maritime cooperation, disaster
management and cultural and people-to-people contacts.
Introduced by Xi in 2O13, the Belt and Road initiative is the centerpiece of China’ s
economic diplomacy .
China appears keen to invest in large infrastructure projects in foreign countries
since the beginning of the belt and road initiative.
Under the initiative which comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st
Century Maritime Silk Road, China is focusing on building a trade and
infrastructure network for connecting Asian countries with Europe and Africa along
the ancient Silk Road routes.
The aim is to boost development of other countries and their trade with China.
Beijing is also working on a Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar , or BCIM economic
corridor , to connect South Asia with Southeast Asia.
Xi arrived in Dhaka on Friday morning on a two-day state visit, first by a Chinese
head of state in the past 3O years. Before his arrival, Beijing said the focus would
be on pushing forward the framework within the belt and road initiative.××

Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Friday underscored the importance of
establishing seamless connectivity between Bangladesh and China through Myanmar,
highlighting the mutual benefits that can be reaped through such an initiative.
""We need seamless connectivity between Bangladesh and China, and the most viable route
passes through Myanmar,"" he said, emphasizing the necessity of a stable Myanmar and the
sustainable repatriation of Rohingya refugees to the Rakhine State.
""We hope for the return of a peaceful and stable Myanmar, including the return of the
Rohingyas to the Rakhine State with rights and security, so that this connectivity can be
established to ensure the mutual benefit of our people,"" he added.
Touhid made these remarks while inaugurating the International Conference on 'China-
South Asia Civilization and Connectivity: History and Contemporary Issues' at North South
University (NSU) in Dhaka.
The foreign affairs adviser highlighted Bangladesh's strategic location and growing
economic potential, asserting the country's commitment to fostering connectivity that
benefits all stakeholders.
""This would go a long way in driving economic growth, reducing poverty, and enhancing
cultural exchanges,"" he said.
Touhid further noted that regional connectivity has become increasingly crucial in
addressing global challenges such as climate change and economic uncertainty.BN

as strategic partners but as friends,"" he said.
Referring to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), of which Bangladesh is a key partner,
Touhid said the initiative embodies the spirit of shared prosperity.
""The development of infrastructure, trade corridors, and people-to-people exchanges
under this initiative aligns seamlessly with aspirations for sustainable development and
regional integration,"" he observed.
The adviser reiterated the significance of enhancing the Bangladesh-China partnership,
which has evolved into a 'Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership' this year.
""This new partnership is built on the very foundations of trust, mutual respect, and a
shared vision of a brighter future,"" he said.
However, Touhid pointed out the need to address contemporary challenges such as
geopolitical tensions, climate change, and economic disparities through collective action.
""As responsible neighbors, China and South Asian nations must work together to ensure
peace, stability, and development in the region,"" he emphasized.
Touhid also acknowledged the transformative spirit within Bangladesh, referring to the
recent mass upsurge led by the country's youths.
""This renewed sense of purpose, what we refer to as the spirit of a 'New Bangladesh,' is a
commitment to building a more inclusive, equitable, and innovative society while
redefining our role on the global stage,"" he said.

(CSCSS) of NSU and Yunnan University, China.

Bangladesh’s ascent to middle power means it will have to be more strategic than ever with
its diplomacy
Phot o: PMO

 Publish : 30 Sep 2023, 08:00 AM
x25/05/2025, 14:57 A delicate balance of power
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/326661/a-delicate-balance-of-power 1/5In the heart of South Asia, Bangladesh, a nation of rich cultural heritage and a complex history,
has been quietly but resolutely ascending from its tumultuous past as a newly independent nation
in 1971 to its present status as a burgeoning middle power in the international arena.
This remarkable journey is a testament of national development, foreign policy success, and the
effective governance that has been put in place over the decades. From rapid economic growth to
unique geographical location along with global partnerships have made Bangladesh an influential
middle power.
This article explores Bangladesh's journey towards becoming a middle power and its relevance to
superpowers in the contemporary global landscape.
One of the most significant indicators of Bangladesh's ascent has been its economic growth and
development. Under “Vision 2021,” Bangladesh transformed itself from a least developed
country (LDC) to a developing one.
And “Vision 2041” has been adopted in line with “Vision 2021” to provide impetus to the dream
of the nation -- with the aim to end absolute poverty and become a developed nation by 2041.
Once Bangladesh was referred to as a “bottomless basket” after independence and now, it is the
second largest economy in South Asia.
Bangladesh's economic success has not gone unnoticed on the global stage. The country's
consistent GDP growth has led to its classification as a ""Next Eleven'' (N-11) economy, a group
of nations expected to play a significant role in the 21st century global economy. Bangladesh's
economic ascent is not only relevant to its own citizens but also to superpowers and the broader
international community. This potential economic growth is the reason why the US, China,
Russia, Japan, India and the rest of the world are paying attention towards Bangladesh.
Neighbours and beyond
Regarding the BCIM (Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar)) economic corridor, Bangladesh
plays a pivotal role in facilitating road, rail, and maritime connectivity within these four
countries. Indian critics of BCIM state that China cannot be trusted and here, BBIN (Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, Nepal) another economic corridor may boost regional cooperation and security in
this region.
x25/05/2025, 14:57 A delicate balance of power
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/326661/a-delicate-balance-of-power 2/5Thus, Bangladesh is one of the potential factors for both China and India in this region to
determine who will establish supremacy. Moreover, China has invested tens of billions of dollars
on Bangladesh's infrastructure, with projects like the Padma Bridge Rail link, Karnaphuli River
Tunnel, the Dhaka-Chittagong highway and many more.
These investments are part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and aim to enhance
connectivity between China, Bangladesh, and beyond. China's BRI is a strategy that seeks to
connect Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime networks to improve regional
integration, increase trade, and stimulate economic growth. China sees Bangladesh as an “all
weather friend” and one of their “strategic partners.”
In April 2023, Bangladesh formally announced its ""Indo-Pacific Outlook"" (IPO) to the world
emphasizing its principle of foreign policy (Article 25 of the constitution) which states
“friendship to all, malice to none.” The objectives include strengthening partnerships, promoting
dialogue, maintaining maritime safety and security, combating transnational organized crime
along with sustainable development, building resilient value chains, and enhancing health
security in these Indo-Pacific region.
China and the US
To counter Chinese influence in this region, the United States of America also announced their
“Indo-Pacific Strategy” that emphasizes America's vision for a free, open, connected, prosperous,
resilient, and secure Indo-Pacific region.
The bargaining position and competition between America and China have developed in this
region, especially regarding the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh's strategic location on the Bay of
Bengal makes it a crucial node in China's BRI. Bangladesh's geographic position offers a vital
route for China's trade and energy corridors, reducing its dependence on the Malacca Strait. On
the other hand, Bangladesh's location is significant for America's Indo-Pacific strategy, which
emphasizes maintaining maritime security, freedom of navigation, and regional stability.
Bangladesh's engagement with both China's BRI and America's Indo-Pacific strategy involves
careful diplomatic balancing. While it seeks economic benefits and infrastructure development
from China, it also values its strategic and security relationships with the United States.
The Bay of Bengal is enriched with natural resources that need to be explored with the
cooperation of developed countries along with higher technology. This prospect of a “blue
economy” has also increased the importance of Bangladesh to the outside world. If Bangladesh
x25/05/2025, 14:57 A delicate balance of power
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/326661/a-delicate-balance-of-power 3/5gives a special facility to any country in the Bay of Bengal, it can be a game changer in terms of
regional politics that will have severe global implications.
The recent visit of French President Emmanuel Macron in Bangladesh can be seen to consolidate
one of his country's Indo-Pacific strategies. Furthermore, Russian foreign minister Lavrov’s visit
to Bangladesh comes at a time when there is an invisible battle between the superpowers. From
their visits to Bangladesh, it is evident that not only regionally but also globally, Bangladesh is
now an emerging middle power.
Summits and confer ences
The recent BRICS and G-20 summits are also significant for Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh
could not become a member of BRICS this time, Bangladesh is a member of NDB (New
Development Bank) under BRICS and Bangladesh will undoubtedly be a promising country in
the next conference of BRICS.
At the G-20 summit, addressing “One Earth,” Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh
stressed on strengthening global solidarity and taking concerted efforts to tackle the global crisis,
giving a four-point recommendation.
She emphasized that for the sake of humanity, to establish peace and harmony throughout the
world, developed nations with major economies must come forward. Regarding climate induced
migration, she urged all to operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund as early as possible for
creating additional financing mechanisms and emphasized that in the upcoming COP-28, every
country should implement this fund with accountability and transparency.
Furthermore, she also emphasized Rohingya repatriation and the need for support of the
international community regarding this. Bangladesh also made “sideline diplomacy” in this
summit through having unofficial talks with various presidents and prime ministers of powerful
nations which have immense implications for further trade and investment opportunities.
Bangladesh's journey from a fledgling nation to a middle power is a remarkable testament to its
resilience and determination. Its economic growth, diplomatic initiatives, and soft power have
garnered the attention of economies large and small.
Bangladesh's relevance lies in its economic potential, regional significance, and extraction of
natural resources and contributions to global challenges. Cooperation with Bangladesh could
advance the interests of other economies and allow Bangladesh to continue its ascent on the
world stage.

https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/awami-league-bnp-unite-to-launch-bangladesh-china-silk-road-forum 3/12Bangladesh joined the BRI during Chinese President Xi Jinping’ s visit to Dhaka in 2016. The initiative aims
to rebuild the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond through massive infrastructural
spending.
However , the initiative has been the subject of controversy in many western capitals, particularly
Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and trap countries into
debt through “nontransparent” projects.
India did not join the BRI, citing concerns over China’ s projects with Pakistan. Some analysts say India is
not comfortable with Bangladesh’ s participation in the initiative.
“This is the time,” Rizvi said about the new Forum, adding that the government does not see any conflict in
the relations with India and China.
“Our support and participation in BRI does not exclude us from participation in other initiatives such as
Indo-Pacific strategy ,” he said as India is one of the key partners of the strategy pursued by the United
States.25/05/2025, 10:59 Awami League, BNP unite to launch Bangladesh China Silk Road Forum
https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/awami-league-bnp-unite-to-launch-bangladesh-china-silk-road-forum 4/12“We in Bangladesh do not see any conflict between the two. Both these have their own reasons and
purposes. Both of them will advance our goal and prosperity ,” he said.
“What is also very important that Indo-China relations over the last 10 years have improved phenomenally .
India is one of the largest trading partners of China. Their relations are improving. So we need not to worry
that one is at the cost of the other .
“This is not a zero-sum game. It’ s a positive-sum game. W e get benefit with all these initiatives and we
should place ourselves into these.”
Ambassador Zhang Zuo said the Bangladesh-China Silk Road Forum is being established “at the right
moment when there is a lot to be achieved”.
“Bangladesh’ s diplomatic policy of “friend to all, malice to none” and President Xi Jinping’ s ‘Thought of
diplomacy’, both have provided new opportunities for win-win cooperation for our two countries,” he said.
“Bangladeshi people’ s dream of a strong and wealthy nation, manifested in the dream of Sonar Bangla,
and the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation pursued by the Chinese people, are interconnected.”
Zuo hoped that this forum “could pay attention to telling good stories about China-Bangladesh friendship,
passing on the voices in the communication and exchanges between our two countries, and building this
forum into an important bridge for China-Bangladesh connectivity .”
Next year , Bangladesh and China will mark the 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties. “W e need to work
together to create a congenial atmosphere for cooperation and deepen our policy connectivity and people-
to-people bond, so as to bring more benefits to both our peoples, and push the China-Bangladesh relations
into a better new era.”Ad

balancing the world order .
“Purely western domination cannot bring good to total population,” he said. “There needs some kind of

“As it [BRI] unifies the world through the process of development, the BRI in fact is a global project,” he
said.
“We’ll move in the sense of a competition, not conflict which has become an apparent trend in the western
world.”
Columnist Abul Maksud described Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina “pragmatic” for maintaining balanced

G7 aims to counter Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative
(Carbis Bay, England)Published: 13 Jun 2021, 13: 45
The Group of Seven richest democracies sought on Saturday to counter China’s growing
influence by offering developing nations an infrastructure plan that could rival president
Xi Jinping’s multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative.
The G7, whose leaders are meeting in southwestern England, has been searching for a
coherent response to the growing assertiveness of Xi after China’s surging economic and
military rise over the past 40 years.Reuters

China on trade and human rights Reuters25/05/2025, 10:34 G7 aims to counter Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative
https://en.prothomalo.com/international/g7-aims-to-counter-xis-belt-and-road-initiative 1/4US president Joe Biden and other G7 leaders hope their plan, known as the Build Back
Better World (B3W) initiative, will provide a transparent infrastructure partnership to
help narrow the $40 trillion needed by developing nations by 2035, the White House said.
“This is not just about confronting or taking on China,” a senior official in Biden’s
administration said. “But until now we haven’t offered a positive alternative that reflects
our values, our standards and our way of doing business.”
The United States later said there was a G7 consensus on the need for a shared approach to
China on trade and human rights.
The G7 and its allies will use the B3W initiative to mobilise private-sector capital in areas
such as climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and
equality, the White House added.
It was not immediately clear how exactly the plan would work or how much capital it
would ultimately allocate.
China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which Xi launched in 2013, involves
development and investment initiatives that would stretch from Asia to Europe and
beyond.
More than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects
like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure.
Critics say Xi’s plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route to link
China with Asia, Europe and beyond is a vehicle for the expansion of Communist China.
Beijing says such doubts betray the “imperial hangover” of many Western powers that
humiliated China for centuries.
China’s Rise
Leaders of the G7 - the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Japan -
want to use their gathering in the seaside resort of Carbis Bay to show the world that the
richest democracies can offer an alternative to China’s growing clout.
The re-emergence of China as a leading global power is considered to be one of the most
significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union
that ended the Cold War.25/05/2025, 10:34 G7 aims to counter Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative
https://en.prothomalo.com/international/g7-aims-to-counter-xis-belt-and-road-initiative 2/4China in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than Italy’s, but after opening to foreign
investment and introducing market reforms, it has become the world’s second-largest
economy and is a global leader in a range of new technologies.
The US official said until now, the West had failed to offer a positive alternative to the
“lack of transparency, poor environmental and labour standards, and coercive approach”
of the Chinese government that had left many countries worse off.
According to a Refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, more than 2,600 projects at a cost
of $3.7 trillion were linked to the BRI, although the Chinese foreign ministry said last June
that about 20% of projects had been seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
As part of the G7 plan, the United States will work with the US Congress to supplement
existing development financing and to “collectively catalyze hundreds of billions of
dollars of infrastructure investment”, the White House said.
Criticism Over Camps
Biden made “forceful comments” to G7 leaders about the need to make a strong
statement on Washington and rights group say is the use of forced labour in China, but
there was a “spectrum of how far different countries are willing to go” in their criticism in
a final communique from the three-day summit, another US official said.
The US official later said the G7 had reached consensus on the need for a shared approach
on “non-market economic practices” and on human rights abuses, and to coordinate on
supply-chain resilience.
The United States has pushed for specific language in the communique about alleged
forced labour in the China’s Xinjiang region, officials said.
UN experts and rights groups estimate over a million people, mainly Uyghurs and other
Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in
Xinjiang.
China denies all accusations of forced labour or abuse. It initially denied the camps
existed, but has since said they are vocational centres and are designed to combat
extremism. In late 2019, China said all people in the camps had “graduated”.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.25/05/2025, 10:34 G7 aims to counter Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/361833/bangladesh-seeks-more-defence-cooperation-from 1/3Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain has sought more defence sector cooperation from
Beijing, saying Chinese training has increased Bangladesh's UN peacekeeping capabilities.
""We have very important defence cooperation between China and Bangladesh. China is a major
supplier of our defence equipment. And the modernization of our military services that we are
looking forward to, I think we need a lot of cooperation in this respect from China,"" he said while
speaking at a seminar on Bangladesh-China relations Monday.
Another area he mentioned is cooperation in personnel training.
""We have very deep defence training cooperation and this needs to continue and be enhanced, if
possible,"" the adviser said, adding: ""Cooperation with China also increased our capability in
participation in UN peacekeeping operations which are important for our country.""
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen and experts from both sides spoke at the seminar
organized by the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) in
collaboration with the Centre for China Studies, DU.
The foreign adviser said that it is likely that the post-revolution trajectory of Bangladesh and its
future relations with China might be influenced by various factors, including Bangladesh's
political stability as well as the changing dynamics of regional and global politics.
Rohingya crisis
The adviser also sought China's support for resolving the Rohingya crisis. He particularly
mentioned Chinese influence in Myanmar while seeking Beijing's ""active role"" in this regard.
""We know China has been cooperating with us for their return. The only solution to the problem
is their return to their homeland. There is also a tripartite mechanism. We all know China has a lot
of influence in Myanmar. Let us accept the realities. We look forward to China's more active role
in their return,"" he said.

China spent $240b bailing out ‘Belt & Road’ countries:
Study
JohannesburgPublished: 28 Mar 2023, 11: 10
China spent $240 billion bailing out 22 developing countries between 2008 and 2021, with
the amount soaring in recent years as more have struggled to repay loans spent building
“Belt & Road” infrastructure, according to a study published Tuesday.
Almost 80 per cent of the rescue lending was made between 2016 and 2021, mainly to
middle-income countries including Argentina, Mongolia and Pakistan, according to theReuters
Paramilitary police officers stand guard in front of the headquarters of the People's Bank of
China, the central bank (PBOC), in Beijing, China September 30, 2022 Reuters25/05/2025, 10:38 China spent $240b bailing out ‘Belt & Road’ countries: Study
https://en.prothomalo.com/international/oxy2vd6wcw 1/3report by researchers from the World Bank, Harvard Kennedy School, AidData and the Kiel
Institute for the World Economy.
China has lent hundreds of billions of dollars to build infrastructure in developing
countries, but lending has tailed off since 2016 as many projects have failed to pay the
expected financial dividends.
“Beijing is ultimately trying to rescue its own banks. That’s why it has gotten into the
risky business of international bailout lending,” said Carmen Reinhart, a former World
Bank chief economist and one of the study’s authors.
Chinese loans to countries in debt distress soared from less than 5 per cent of its overseas
lending portfolio in 2010 to 60 per cent in 2022, the study found.
Argentina received the most, with $111.8 billion, followed Pakistan on $48.5 billion and
Egypt with $15.6 billion. Nine countries received less than $1 billion.
People’s Bank of China (PBOC) swap lines accounted for $170 billion of the rescue
financing, including in Suriname, Sri Lanka and Egypt. Bridge loans or balance of
payments support by Chinese state-owned banks was $70 billion. Rollovers of both kinds
of loan were $140 billion.
The study was critical of some central banks potentially using the PBOC swap lines to
artifically pump up their foreign exchange reserve figures.
China’s rescue lending is “opaque and uncoordinated,” said Brad Parks, one of the
report’s authors, and director of AidData, a research lab at William & Mary College in the
United States.
The bailout loans are mainly concentrated in the middle income countries that make up
four-fifths of its lending, due to the risk they pose to Chinese banks’ balance sheets,
whereas low income countries are offered grace periods and maturity extensions, the
report said.
China is negotiating debt restructurings with countries including Zambia, Ghana and Sri
Lanka and has been criticised for holding up the processes. In response, it has called on
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to also offer debt relief.25/05/2025, 10:38 China spent $240b bailing out ‘Belt & Road’ countries: Study

Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen on Thursday said the visit of the largest-ever
business delegation to Bangladesh from China, led by Chinese Minister of Commerce Wang
Wentao, later this month will send a strong signal of openness, cooperation and mutual benefit,
and will elevate the Bangladesh-China economic and trade relations to a new level.
“We are confident that this visit will send a strong signal of openness, cooperation and mutual
benefit, and will elevate China-Bangladesh economic and trade relations to a new level,” he said,
adding that the Chinese minister will lead more than 100 Chinese investors to visit Bangladesh at
the end of this month.
During the visit, the two sides will co-host a trade and investment exchange event, where
hundreds of Chinese and Bangladeshi enterprises will engage and explore more cooperation
opportunities.
Yao said the 15th meeting of the Bangladesh-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission will
be held to agree on concrete measures to further the two sides' economic and trade cooperation.
The Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) organised the country
lecture on “Five Decades of Bangladesh-China Relations: Towards a New Height” at the BIISS

The second Belt and Road Forum (BRF) was recently held in Beijing. This is the
second time the forum took stock and set the pathways for future endeavours of
the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since this major initiative was launched in 2013.

There will be zero tolerance
for corruption in BRI
projects. Special care has to
be taken so that all project
planning meets the
environmental standards
and no damage is done in
the construction process to
the environment.In his address to the forum, President Xi Jinping also set new guidelines for the
BRI to proceed in the coming years. He laid a lot of emphasis on the progress of
BRI for the common good of humanity. In his words: ""The flow of goods, capital,
technology and people can provide strong impetus and broad space for economic
growth. As the Chinese saying goes, 'The ceaseless flow of rivers makes the
oceans deep.' However, were such inflow to be cut, the ocean, however big, would
eventually dry up.""
In his speech, the Chinese president also touched upon some areas where BRI has
to take special care and note. Specifically, all BRI projects in the future will have
to adhere to strict international standards in quality. Projects will also have to be
clean and green. There will be zero tolerance for any misappropriation or
corruption in BRI projects. Special care has to be taken so that all project
planning meets the environmental standards and no damage is done in the
construction process to the environment.
Issues of the so-called ""debt trap"" also came up for discussion. It was pointed out
that both lending and borrowing countries have to be more responsible for debt
management and borrowing should only be done with capacity of repayment in
mind. The five key areas of focus of BRI were also emphasised upon during the
forum: policy coordination, connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration
and people-to-people contact. It was pointed out that for the successful
implementation of BRI, all these five areas of focus must receive the highest
attention.
A number of sideline events also took
place during the forum touching
upon specific aspects of the initiative:
there was a CEOs' forum on joint
investment and business
opportunities; a Belt and Road News
Network meeting; a Belt and Road
Studies Network meeting comprising
of major think tanks in BRI countries,
to name a few. A number of new
initiatives were also launched to
support the BRI—notable amongst them are the Beijing Initiative for Clean Silk
Road, Belt and Road Energy Partnership, Belt and Road Initiative Tax
Administration Cooperation Mechanism. The International Silk Road Academy of
Science was also launched along with the Alliance of International Science
Organizations in the Belt and Road Region. The Belt and Road News Network will
be a platform for cooperation amongst major news outlets and media houses in
BRI countries. Similarly, the newly launched Belt and Road Studies Network will
be a platform to bring together major think tanks in BRI countries to carry out
research studies on different aspects of the initiative and provide policy inputs.
A special emphasis was also put on creating the Digital Silk Road Initiative. It was
well understood that in this age of digital revolution, physical infrastructure
alone cannot bring prosperity to people. There is thus the need for creating an
effective digital infrastructure connecting all countries in BRI. It is well-known
that BRI is a people-centric project. Therefore, people-to-people interaction
amongst BRI countries is of utmost importance. People's connectivity in the BRI
region through exchanges and expansion of tourism is of significance. China will
also support 5,000 people from the innovation centres in BRI countries through
conducting exchanges, training programmes and joint research over the next five
years. Another 10,000 representatives of political parties, think tanks, non-
government organisations from countries participating in BRI will be invited to
China for exchanges in the next five years. To sum it up, the BRF shed light on the
new pathways for progress of the BRI in the next few years.
Bangladesh is a signatory country of BRI. It is also a key strategic partner of the
initiative. Of the six economic corridors upon which the concept of BRI is built,
one corridor will pass through Bangladesh. The old Bangladesh-China-India-
Myanmar (BCIM) corridor is now to become the BRI corridor linking Kunming to
Kolkata. There are only two corridors of the six corridors which are identified as
maritime corridors and the old BCIM corridor is one of them. It will start at
Kunming in China, pass through Myanmar and Bangladesh, and end up in
Kolkata, India. Recently, a bilateral contract has been signed between China and
Myanmar known as China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC).
Bangladesh is going to start implementing other BRI projects very shortly. During
the visit of President Xi Jinping in Bangladesh in 2016, a USD 40 billion package
was pledged and necessary MOUs signed, of which USD 26 billion is meant for
infrastructural development under BRI. Bangladesh stands to benefit enormously
when these projects are completed; we will be linked by land through the
corridor to the Chinese mainland which will then lead to connectivity through
the other corridors to the rest of the world.
However, managing such massive infrastructural investment and development is
not always easy. We will need to develop our policy and management capacities to
reap the benefits of this initiative. In identifying the projects, we must give
priority to our national needs and objectives. Being a climate-change-affected
country, we will have to be extra cautious and sensitive in maintaining the
highest environmental standards in all these projects. The so-called debt trap
should also warn us that we have to be responsible and cautious in taking debts
and managing them well. Transparency and accountability should be maintained
in the planning and execution of these large projects. Project completion
maintaining the highest degree of quality and international standards is of
utmost importance. Going by our past record and experience, this is quite a tall
order but given the size and importance of the projects, we cannot afford to
compromise on any account.
BRI is a comprehensive undertaking that can transform our development
endeavours and also support us in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
We will need to have a coordinated policy approach in three policy domains:
trade, finance and investment (TFI). Only then can we better streamline the
efforts to a win-win outcome.
Any mega project of this scale will also have geopolitical and geostrategic
implications. We must therefore also carefully analyse these aspects as we move
towards implementation of BRI.
In his speech at the forum, President Xi Jinping said: ""Joint development of the
Belt and Road Initiative embraces the historical trend of economic globalisations,
responds to the call for global governance system reform and conforms to the
strong desire of people of all countries to live better lives.""
Indeed, development and improving people's lives should be our goal.

Says Jetro president
Kazushige Nobutani, president of the Japan External Trade Organisation
(Jetro), is scheduled to come to Bangladesh today along with Yasutoshi
Nishimura, minister for economy, trade and industry of Japan. Their visit is
aimed at discussing the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) the two
countries plan to ink in order to promote trade and investments.
In an email interview with The Daily Star, Nobutani spoke about investment
opportunities in Bangladesh for Japanese firms and challenges the face, among
other issues.
DS: A lot of Japanese companies located in China also want to relocate to other
countries, including Bangladesh. Do you think that Bangladesh has the
opportunity to attract some of them?
Nobutani: Japanese companies are trying to diversify the supply chain not only
from China but to other regions, especially the Association of South East Asian
Nations. I believe Bangladesh is one of them.
DS: How do you see the business potential for Japanese investors in
Bangladesh?
Nobutani: There are a lot of business opportunities for Japanese companies in
Bangladesh.
First, we see a lot of export-oriented industries utilising abundant human
resources in Bangladesh.
Since the 1980s, some Japanese companies, especially those based in the
Chittagong Export Processing Zone, set up export-oriented industries and they
are still doing very good business in Bangladesh.
Second, based on Jica's support, mega infrastructure development projects are
going on in Bangladesh. Since Bangladesh is one of the fast-growing economies in
the world, Japanese companies are showing great interest in developing
infrastructures in the country.
Third, there is a huge domestic market in Bangladesh. Jetro Dhaka is getting a lot
of queries from Japanese companies to market their products in Bangladesh. We
see more opportunities in domestic market-oriented businesses. Lastly, the ICT
and startup sectors are more focused areas in Bangladesh for Japanese
companies.
DS: Do you think Bangladesh could create an investment-friendly environment?
Nobutani: I appreciate Bangladesh's government for working very hard to
improve the business environment.
Our focused activity is to work with the government to create a more business-
friendly environment in Bangladesh. We normally get a variety of opinions from
Japanese investors regarding the business environment in Bangladesh and raise
these issues with related ministries and agencies. Bangladesh is sincerely
working to address the issues.
We believe that the success of existing Japanese companies will bring more FDI
from Japan. That's why we are working very hard to support the existing Japanese
companies.
DS: What initiatives should Bangladesh take to attract Japanese investments?
Nobutani: Japanese companies always compare business environment and
incentives when they decide on investment. To attract Japanese investments,
Bangladesh should have better business environment and incentives than other
countries.
Japanese companies have long experience in Asian countries, and we are ready to
support Bangladesh to have a better business environment based on our
experiences.
DS: What types of opportunities are available in Bangladesh for investments?
Nobutani: Japan is facing an ageing society and the population is going down. It's
high time for Japan to work together with Bangladesh to get the source of
economic growth for both countries.
Bangladesh is a time-tested friend of Japan and we believe that we can work
together for win-win relations in business.
DS: How can Jetro help Bangladesh attract Japanese investments?
Nobutani: Jetro works together with Bangladesh to provide investment
opportunities for Japanese companies. We don't have any shortcuts to promote
Japanese investment. I believe the shortest way is to address the issue one by one
to facilitate more business from Japan.
DS: What will the potential sectors for Japanese investors in Bangladesh in the
coming days?
Nobutani: Startup is a potential sector for investments for Japanese investors.
Startups are growing industries in Bangladesh, and we believe Japanese
companies can collaborate with them to deliver services.
Energy is a sector that is vital for realising a carbon-neutral Bangladesh. So, it is
important for Bangladesh to introduce environmental-friendly energy.
DS: Do you think Japanese investors face any obstacles to investment in
Bangladesh?
Nobutani: There are a number of obstacles to investment in Bangladesh. We see
bureaucratic challenges in custom procedures and tax administrations.
We want more transparency and predictability in administrative procedures. I
believe that digitalisation and one-stop service would be good methods for having
a better environment.
Amid the Ukraine war, the world is facing difficulties owing to the price hike of
energy and essentials. Bangladesh is not an exception.
As Bangladesh needs to import raw materials, foreign exchange regulations are
crucial for Japanese companies to operate businesses. Once the difficulties are
over, I'd like to expect Bangladesh's government to take initiatives for better
regulations in the foreign exchange policy.
Japanese companies would like to contribute to industrial diversification in
Bangladesh. However, industrial diversification takes long time for getting
investment and technical transfer from outside.
In order to do that, long time and consistency in the policies are crucial. We
would like to emphasise that Bangladesh learns from Japanese companies to
develop industries.
DS: How can Bangladesh increase exports to Japan?
Nobutani: Bangladesh should increase the portfolio of export goods, especially
value-added goods in the RMG sector. Japan and Bangladesh governments have
set up the joint study group for bilateral EPA in December.
EPA is more comprehensive than free trade agreement (FTA). According to our
survey, 85 per cent of Japanese companies in Bangladesh are wishing to have a
bilateral FTA or EPA before Bangladesh graduates from the LDC group in 2026.
We also came to know that without FTA or EPA, 20 per cent of existing Japanese
companies in Bangladesh would consider relocation or reduce procurement from
Bangladesh in the future. I believe EPA would not only avoid relocation but also
help Bangladesh to increase exports to Japan.
DS: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, during his visit to India in April,
touted the idea of a new industrial hub for the Bay of Bengal and northeast
India. How will it be materialised?
Nobutani: The Japanese government would like to work with Bangladesh to
realise ""Free and Open Indo Pacific"". In the prime minister's speech, Bangladesh
was cited as the hub of the region.
Japan is supporting to develop Matarbari deep seaport. The seaport will be the
gateway to approach the northeastern region of India. At the end of the day,
Matarbari could be the hub for exporting to other regions. Literally, Matarbari
would be a game-changer in this region.

He also said China will uphold international fairness and justice and the basic
norm of non-interference in internal affairs in international relations of
Bangladesh, says a statement of the Chinese foreign ministry.
Yi made the statements when he and Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul
Momen held a bilateral meeting in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent on the sidelines
of a conference on Central and South Asia Connectivity Challenges and
Opportunities hosted by the Uzbek government on Thursday.
This is significant as China is going ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative, which
seeks to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and maritime networks
aimed at improving regional integration, increasing trade and stimulating
economic growth. Bangladesh has already joined the initiative.
On the other hand, the US also wants Bangladesh to join US-led Indo-Pacific
Strategy (IPS), which seeks to ensure free and open Indo-Pacific and international
rules upheld in maritime affairs.
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming in May this year had said
Bangladesh should not join ""Quad"".
Bangladesh's relations with China will ""substantially get damaged"" if it joins it. He
had termed Quad, of which US, Japan, Australia and India are members, a
military alliance aiming against China's resurgence and its relationship with
neighbouring countries.
Bangladesh always maintained that it will not join any military alliance, but is
willing to join any initiative beneficial for national or regional socio-economic
development.
During the meeting in Tashkent, Chinese Foreign Minister Yi also told Momen
that China was willing to work with Bangladesh to maintain the development
momentum of the China-Bangladesh strategic partnership of cooperation, says
the statement of the Chinese foreign ministry.
He added that China highly appreciates Bangladesh's firm support of China's
legitimate stance on issues concerning China's core interests.
The Chinese minister also said China will continue to provide Bangladesh with
vaccines to meet its needs, and is ready to discuss vaccine-filling cooperation
with Bangladesh to help the country fight against the pandemic.
Under an agreement, Chinese company Sinopharm is supplying vaccines to
Bangladesh. Of the 15 million vaccines as contracted, China has already supplied
2 million and is scheduled to supply 5 million vaccine jabs early next month.
As gift, it has provided 1.1 million.
Dhaka and Beijing are also working for co-production of vaccines in Bangladesh.
Yi said China stands ready to provide support and assistance to help with
Bangladesh's poverty alleviation through the China-South Asian Countries
Poverty Alleviation and Cooperative Development Center, which was launched in
China on July 8.
Momen told Yi that Bangladesh always insists on the one-China principle and
firmly supports China on issues related to China's internal affairs, such as the
issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet.
Bangladesh thanked China for its timely assistance with vaccines at a critical time
and opposes making the search for the coronavirus origin a political issue, the
statement said.
Bangladesh wishes to launch vaccine-filling cooperation with China, and enhance
anti-pandemic cooperation under the framework of the six-nation cooperation
mechanism, namely Bangladesh, China, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri
Lanka.
Momen said China has set an example of poverty alleviation for the world and
hopes to learn from China's experience in lifting the country out of poverty.
He expected China to continue to play a mediating and constructive role in
properly resolving the issue of Rohingya crisis, added the statement.",0.0107,0.226133333,,Neutral

UNESCAP asks cost-beneﬁt analysis of Chinaʼs belt and

The UNESCAP’ s Asia-pacific countries with Special Needs Development Report 2017 says despite
multiple benefits, the initiative may bring about some potential risks to the countries with special needs.
To promote a vision of expanding links between Asia, Africa and Europe underpinned by billions of dollars
in infrastructure investment, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the initiative in 2013.
Bangladesh joined it last year during Xi’ s visit to Dhaka when he promised a massive funding for
infrastructure development.
Beijing is going to host a mega forum of this initiative drawing global leaders fromSunday . Bangladesh’ s
Minister for Industries Amir Hossain Amu will represent the country .
India, however , has reservations because of “sovereignty issues”. New Delhi opposed the China-Pakistan
Economic Corridor , part of the belt and road initiative, as it is proposed to pass through the Pakistan-
occupied Kashmir region that India claims its own.Updated :  13 May 2017, 10:27 PM

https://bdnews24.com/economy/unescap-asks-cost-benefit-analysis-of-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative 2/10China proposed this Initiative to establish a network of regional infrastructure to promote trade, investment,
and economic integration.
This initiative will not only promote international trade and investment in the region but also facilitate the
exchange of ideas and culture, accelerate regional economic integration, and eventually promote regional
economic development and improve the people’ s lives.
The UNESCAP  report released last week, however , said it might increase pollution as infrastructure
development proceeds.
Infrastructure development associated with the initiative may also increase foreign debt as Countries with
Special Needs, CNS will need to borrow from financial institutions.
The group of 36 LDCs, landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing States
(SIDS) in the region are collectively known CSN.25/05/2025, 11:04 UNESCAP asks cost-benefit analysis of China’s belt and road initiative
https://bdnews24.com/economy/unescap-asks-cost-benefit-analysis-of-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative 3/10Borrowing from the financial institutions is a concern for the countries that already have high levels of debt,
the report says.
For instance, in 2015, the foreign debt-GDP  ratio was 86 percent in the Lao People’ s Democratic Republic,
84 percent in Kazakhstan, 95 percent in Azerbaijan, and 153 percent in Mongolia.
“Moreover , large-scale infrastructure projects may contribute to de-industrialisation in CSN, as greater
connectivity to China may induce large inflows of Chinese exports, such that developing countries along
the BRI corridors may experience a decline in industrial production”.
“While international trade and investment may increase the income of some groups of people, it may also
cause unemployment and a decline in income among others, thereby contributing to greater levels of
income inequality ,” the report said.
“It is important to conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses for infrastructure projects.”
For business firms involved, explicit and implicit benefits and costs must be considered, spanning both in
the short term and the long term. For governments, private and social returns and costs must be
considered.
Since externalities will inevitably emerge together with infrastructure development, governments involved in
the belt and road initiative must be prepared to provide fiscal subsidies. “International coordination is also
crucial.”
Many of the infrastructure projects involve countries with dif ferent languages, cultures, and economic and
legal systems. “Communication is important and the parties involved should share information”.Ad25/05/2025, 11:04 UNESCAP asks cost-benefit analysis of China’s belt and road initiative
https://bdnews24.com/economy/unescap-asks-cost-benefit-analysis-of-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative 4/10“Moreover , it is important to devise appropriate operational plans for projects by ensuring that they are well-
designed, well-constructed and meet environmental requirements”.
Chinese Ambassador Ma Mingqiang, last week at a seminar in Dhaka, said the belt and road initiative is
“an answer” to the current global crisis ranging from infrastructure bottleneck to lack of fund and
protectionism and unilateralism.
“How to address those issues and ensure peace and sustainable development, belt and road initiative in
my eye is one of the solutions proposed by China.”
It has five components: policy coordination, investment and trade facilitation, financial integrity ,
infrastructure connectivity and people to people contact.
“It is inclusive rather than exclusive. It’ s based on equality , and mutual respect, rather than discriminatory . It
is a win-win situation,” he had said.

Dhaka-Beijing joint statement
China focuses on political relations, future
DhakaPublished: 13 Jul 2024, 10: 26
China has been focussing hard on strengthening relations with the Bangladesh
government in the political sphere for almost a decade.
This closeness is increasing in twofold - through visits and interactions with top political
leadership as well as the ruling party delegations.
The joint declaration issued Thursday after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s recent visit to
Beijing also reflects the interests of deepening the political relations.Raheed Ejaz
Flags of Bangladesh and China
25/05/2025, 10:12 China focuses on political relations, future, saya an analysis of the joint statement
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/8jct7o0rlk 1/4The way political cooperation, alongside bilateral relations, between the two countries in
the international arena came up this time actually has never been mentioned in the past,
especially since 2010.
For the first time, the two sides have agreed on the issues of democracy, development,
geopolitics, and others, especially regarding Taiwan as a part of China. In particular,
articles 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the 27-point joint statement encapsulated the political
transition of relations, democracy and development, Taiwan issue and the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) and geopolitics.
According to analysts, China has succeeded in including in this joint declaration the
Taiwan issue keeping the future in mind. Likewise, it has reflected its own perceptions in
terms of financing investment and development projects considering the stable political
situation in Bangladesh.
The question remains, how well did Bangladesh think before agreeing to include such
perceptions of China in the joint statement.
Article 5 of the joint statement states, “The Chinese side firmly supports Bangladesh in
maintaining peace and stability, realising development goals as envisioned under Vision
2041, non-interference in its internal affairs, and independently choosing a development
path suited to its national conditions.”
The same article also talked about the Taiwan issue. It states, “Bangladesh reiterated its
firm commitment to the one-China principle and its position that the Government of the
People’s Republic of China represents the whole of China, and Taiwan is part of China, and
Bangladesh supports China on issues pertaining to China’s core interests and China’s
efforts to safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
Diplomatic analysts say, there is a reflection of perception in the joint statement that
China’s one-party governance system gets priority as a favourable system for
Bangladesh’s national development.
Besides, the country has ensured Dhaka’s support in the international arena in future by
getting Bangladesh’s support to China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity including
Taiwan.
Former and current diplomats say that usually the host country prepares the first draft of
the joint statement. Then it is finalised after both sides agree on additions and
subtractions.25/05/2025, 10:12 China focuses on political relations, future, saya an analysis of the joint statement
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/8jct7o0rlk 2/4In most cases, arguments of the stronger sides prevail. Again the host country has some
advantages. If one looks at the elevation of bilateral relations to “partnership” taking this
context into consideration, many think this change has come through the visit of
President Xi Jinping in Bangladesh in October 2016.
But actually, China first mentioned the transition of relations to a partnership in a
statement issued at the end of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s bilateral visit in 2010. And
officially this transition took place. As a result, China drafted the joint statement taking
into account the bilateral and international context in the political arena. Finally,
Bangladesh also agreed.
An analysis of the joint statement reveals, the issue of democracy remains absent while
referring to the internal situation of Bangladesh in the Article 5. But the issues of
democracy and democratic values   have come in Articles 20 and 23.
There is ostensibly no harm in absence of internal democratic practices; rather
development is everything. However, human rights, including democracy, civil and
political rights, must be upheld as a whole in the international arena.
The question is, what is the reason for such conflicting positions on democratic values?
China’s massive project centering the Teesta River has been under discussion for several
years. But the discussions on China’s proposal stalled months before India showed its
interest in the Teesta project last month.
Diplomatic sources also said that the Teesta issue was not raised in the official meeting
during this visit. But Article 11 of the joint declaration states that “The two sides agreed to
enhance cooperation in such fields as agriculture, meteorology, water management and
ecological protection.”
At the same time, in addition to the commitment to increase cooperation between the two
countries in integrated water management, China has also assured to encourage Chinese
investors in Bangladesh’s water resources sector.25/05/2025, 10:12 China focuses on political relations, future, saya an analysis of the joint statement

hand to China during the early days of the Covid outbreak. After the situation in China
improved, China in turn offered their helping hand to Bangladesh.
During those challenging times, important strides were made in the relations between the
two countries, he added.
Ambassador Li Jiming made these remarks at the Prothom Alo office on Sunday.
The outgoing ambassador came to visit the Prothom Alo office in the afternoon. He was
received by the editor of Prothom Alo, Matiur Rahman. They held a meeting to exchange
views.
After the meeting, Li Jiming spoke in an interview with Prothom Alo about bilateral
relations, cooperation and more.
After his stint of more than three years in Bangladesh, Li Jiming will be leaving Dhaka in
the second week of December.
When asked about how relations had been during his term as ambassador, he said he had
felt very honoured to be the ambassador of China to Bangladesh, shouldering the mission
for the President of China, President Xi Jingping to uplift the strategic partnership of
cooperation between China and Bangladesh to a higher level.
Li Jiming further said there had been significant progress and bilateral relationship has
been strengthened in many ways, especially during the pandemic.
He said Bangladesh was the first country to jump on board the Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) in South Asia and sign the MOU in this regard. Over the past three years, BRI has had
a lot of achievements, he said, pointing to the examples of Payra power plant, the
Karnaphuli Tunnel and the Dasherkandi Sewerage Treatment Plant.I estimate that the trade volume between the two countries
will exceed US$ 28 billion this year. That is a historic

""The Bangladesh media is very dynamic and pro-active. The professionalism of the media

Last update on: Tue Oct 6, 2020 01:02 AM
Over the past 45 years, the relationship between China and Bangladesh has been
developing, with mutual cooperation and friendship on both sides. In the
international arena, Bangladesh has, to the best of its capacity, maintained
unwavering support for the ""One China Policy"" and China's peaceful rise.

The Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was associated
with China during his political life. He travelled to China in 1952 for an
international conference. During the visit, he met Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai,
the heroes of the Chinese Revolution. He was impressed by New China. After the
independence of Bangladesh, the work of establishing diplomatic relations with
China under the leadership of Bangabandhu began after overcoming many
adversities.
Sadly, Bangabandhu was killed before formal diplomatic relations were initiated,
but undoubtedly, it was in his hands that the work of establishing diplomatic
relations between Bangladesh and China began. Last year, the present Chinese
Ambassador Li Jiming and all diplomats from the Chinese Embassy visited the
Bangabandhu Memorial Museum. At that time, they paid homage to
Bangabandhu. The curator of the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum said that the
Chinese embassy was the first foreign mission of Bangladesh, whose diplomats
had visited the historic building together.
Chinese Ambassador Li Jiming said, ""China will show the highest respect to the
greatest Bengali of all time, Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman in his birth centenary this year, which also corresponds with the
celebration of the 45th anniversary of Dhaka-Beijing diplomatic ties. While all of
Bangladesh is celebrating ""Mujib Borsho"", the Chinese embassy will also
implement initiatives to celebrate this significant event with our Bangladeshi
friends to show the Chinese people's highest consideration and respect towards
this great man.""
Following in the footsteps of Bangabandhu, his daughter Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina has proved her worth as a visionary leader by leading the unprecedented
development of Bangladesh in recent years. Under the dynamic leadership of the
Prime Minister, Bangladesh is ready to move ahead alongside China as a reliable
ally in the days to come. Already, relations between the two countries have
reached a unique height. In recent years, China has established itself as a major
development partner of Bangladesh.
Proposed in 2013 by the Chinese President Xi Jinping, The Belt and Road Initiative
has become a most popular platform for international cooperation, with very
bright prospects in a world mired with protectionism and unilateralism.
Bangladesh is a proud member of this initiative and can play a significant role in
the advancement of this epic project.
On October 14, 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Bangladesh on a
historic visit. During that visit, China announced huge investments in various
sectors of Bangladesh. The implementation of those investment projects is now in
full swing. Among the ongoing projects are the Padma Multipurpose Bridge
Project, Karnafuli Tunnel, Dhaka-Chittagong Highway Four Lane Upgradation,
Payra Port Development, Chittagong-Cox's Bazar Railway Project, Power Grid
Network Strengthening Project, Dhaka-Ashulia Elevated Expressway, Dhaka-
Sylhet Four Lane Highway etc. Mutual cooperation is not limited to the
government level but is also at the private level. Cultural exchanges between the
people of both countries underwent significant developments in 2019, as over
37,000 Bangladeshi tourists travelled to China and more than 5,000 Bangladeshi
students are studying in China. It is undeniable that the unprecedented
development of Bangladesh's agriculture and garments sector is also due to the
support of Chinese technology.
Moreover, a total of 8,256 Bangladeshi products will now be exempted from tariff
when exporting to China. Bangladesh has described this as a success in economic
diplomacy. This treatment is in addition to the preferential duties that we are
already enjoying from China under the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement.
China has established itself as Bangladesh's most trusted ally in the defence
sector as well. China's valuable involvement in water resource development and
management also has enormous potential for Bangladesh. Recently, there have
been reports of China's cooperation in the overall development of the Teesta
basin, which, if implemented, could radically change certain sectors, including
agriculture and industry, in a large area of North Bengal.
Apart from infrastructural development, China is doing commendable work in
cultural exchanges with Bangladesh. The Confucius Institute has been set up in
various institutions of higher learning in the country. To facilitate Chinese
language education for Bangladeshis, Chinese language courses have been
introduced in various educational institutions including the University of Dhaka
and North South University. Every year, a large number of Bangladeshi students
are going to study in different universities of China with scholarships. Cultural
groups are coming and going every year as part of cultural interactions. However,
these activities should be allowed to spread outside Dhaka city. Organising
carnivals, fairs and exhibitions at the district level can be fruitful in this regard.
China has also established itself as Bangladesh's only all-weather friend by
extending a hand of sympathy and support to Bangladesh during ongoing Covid-
19 pandemic. China's well-planned and regulated strategies to dealing with the
pandemic is an important part of learning for the world. China had earlier
announced that if the Covid-19 vaccine was discovered, Bangladesh would be
given priority in obtaining it.
In Bangladesh, a Chinese company has been allowed to run the third phase trial
of the Sinovac coronavirus vaccine. Under the pragmatic initiative of Bangladesh
PM Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh has sent medical accessories, including masks,
gowns, caps and gloves, to China. The Prime Minister also wrote a letter to the
Chinese President Xi Jinping. In return, the Chinese government sent 10
members of a medical expert team to support Bangladesh's fight against Covid-19.
The medical experts have provided consultations regarding pandemic control,
patients' treatment and laboratory tests, and guidance and training for
Bangladeshi medical professionals.
China has also provided Bangladesh with over three million surgical and N-95
masks, over 110,000 sets of personal protective equipment and a large number of
test kits, thermometers, ventilators, and sanitisers. Moreover, the Beijing-backed
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) said it would lend USD 100 million to
Bangladesh to help the country deal with the pandemic.
The Chinese president has outlined the vision of the Chinese dream, which is to
achieve the great renewal of the Chinese nation. The steady process of attaining
the Chinese dream will not only benefit China, but also the world at large. As
President Xi Jinping pointed out, the Chinese dream of national renewal is about
the pursuit of happiness by every Chinese citizen, and it has much in common
with the dreams of the people of Bangladesh, as we are on the way to achieving
the goal of becoming a middle income country by 2021 and a developed country
by 2041.We are hopeful that Bangladesh and China, with joint efforts, will be able
to develop and maintain practices and policies that will make these dreams come
true.

Rohingya refugee crisis has become a global burning issue. The crisis should therefore be
explained from a broader lens of geo-political and strategic game of power competition. 
Then, a few pertinent questions arise: 
What are the geopolitical and economic factors that have a decisive influence on the Rohingya
refugee crisis? Why does China support Myanmar's position on the Rohingya refugee crisis? To
what extent does the Rohingya refugee crisis impact the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)? 
These questions merit rigorous academic analysis for gaining a better understanding and
informed insights on the changing global and regional order.
Background
With the rise of economic and military power of China, Professor Stephen Walt in his
contribution entitled Rising Powers and the Risks of War: A Realist View of Sino-American
Relations (2018) categorically predicted that the United States and China will increasingly see
each other as rivals and will engage in more intense security competition. 
In the 2017 “crackdown” in Rakhine, about 742,000 Rohingya people were driven out of
Myanmar into neighbouring Bangladesh, and about 6,700 Rohingya men, women, and children
were massacred. 
China has enormous economic and geo-strategic interests in Myanmar's Rakhine State. The Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI) of China is a public policy strategy to advance the issues of
globalization and regional interests. 
The rapid development and far-reaching impact of China's economy during the past 30 years of
the reforms and re-opening are unprecedented in world economic history. The rise of China is a
global phenomenon. 
The BRI of China has already attracted widespread attention from the academic and political
worlds. The BRI intends to establish cooperation in five major directions: Trade and investment
facilitation; policy coordination; infrastructure development and connectivity; financial
coordination and integration; and people-to-people ties and connectivity. 
The BRI involves countries spanning Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania,
Central and Eastern Europe, West Asia, and North Africa -- over 900 projects, and close to $1
trillion as of mid-2018.25/05/2025, 14:20 Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh: BRI perspective
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/296679/rohingya-refugee-crisis-in-bangladesh-bri 2/6China's projected investment under the initiative ranges from $1.4tn to $6tn. 
The Rohingya issue is one of the priorities of Xi Jinping's government in China. Amid the
Rohingya crisis, where about three quarters of a million people fled to Bangladesh following the
military operation in Rakhine State in 2017, Beijing offered diplomatic protection to Naypyidaw
in the face of international opprobrium. 
Bangladesh's security concerns
Sharing borders with Bangladesh, India, and China, Myanmar provides a gateway to the Indian
Ocean. The influx of the Rohingya into the Bangladeshi borderland raises some serious concerns
on our national security. 
As a host nation, Bangladesh faces a number of non-traditional security threats originating from
the Rohingya crisis. 
For instance, drug trafficking is a major threat to regional security and domestic stability. Illicit
drugs have been seen as undermining national unity and, in extreme cases, as resulting in a failed
state. Drug addiction has become a matter of serious societal concern. 
Bangladesh is in close proximity to major drug-producing regions: The Golden Triangle and the
Golden Crescent. Approximately 10.6 million people injected drugs worldwide in 2016, or 0.22%
of the global population aged 15–64. 
Some of the Rohingya are allegedly involved in illicit drug trade due mainly to poverty, illiteracy,
and vulnerability. Recent reports suggest that there is a marriage of convenience among the
insurgent groups of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, human traffickers, and illicit drug dealers. 
Bangladesh has been used as a transit point for international drug traffickers.
When powers collide
In recent years, both China and India have engaged with Bangladesh through various economic
initiatives, loans, and investment offers, through which they both wish to secure their geopolitical
interests in the country.
Accordingly, there has been intense conflict as well as cooperation between China and India.
During the official visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in October 2016, Beijing offered a
package of $24 billion to Dhaka. To counter Beijing's initiatives, the Indian government provided
a $5bn line of credit and other economic assistance to Bangladesh during Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina's visit to New Delhi in April 2017.25/05/2025, 14:20 Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh: BRI perspective
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/296679/rohingya-refugee-crisis-in-bangladesh-bri 3/6Moreover, the United States of America eyes to contain the rise of China. In international politics,
there is a Machiavellian dictum, that is, enemy's enemy is my friend. India and Pakistan, two
nuclearized states in South Asia, are longstanding rivals or enemies. 
Following the Machiavellian principle, China and Pakistan are proven to be time-tested allies and
friends as well. China has a great deal of investments in Pakistan. For example, intense interest in
the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was stimulated when $46bn of investment
agreements were signed in April 2015, a sum which two years later increased to $62bn. 
A major focus of CPEC is on developing overland transportation and pipeline links from the port
of Gwadar to the Chinese province of Xinjiang as a land-based alternative to the maritime “choke
point” of the Straits of Malacca.

Understanding ‘Indo-Pacific'
Recent research suggests that China is setting up a separate economic zone and a deep seaport in
Myanmar. The main objective of China is to establish authority in the whole Bay of Bengal. At
the same time, the US and India operate to contain the Chinese influence and bilateral
engagements with Bangladesh and Myanmar. 
Resultantly, the United States uses the term “Indo-Pacific” as a rebalancing strategy towards
Asia. However, there is no clear and coherent geographic definition of “Indo-Pacific.”25/05/2025, 14:20 Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh: BRI perspective
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/296679/rohingya-refugee-crisis-in-bangladesh-bri 4/6Indo-Pacific is originally a geographic concept that spans two regions of the Indian Ocean and
the Pacific Ocean. Many US scholars view Chinese President Xi Jinping's rise to power and
growing Chinese assertiveness in the South and the East China Sea and the Indian Ocean region
as the major underlying determinants behind the formulation of US Indo-Pacific strategy. 
The Indo-Pacific region is also important for China from a geo-strategic and economic point of
view. China has been pursuing its maritime ports building projects in Djibouti in the horn of
Africa, Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota in Sri Lanka, and in the Maldives and Tanzania. 
In pursuit of access to the Indian Ocean via the Bay of Bengal on the Myanmar side, China
agreed in 2009 to construct a $1.5bn oil pipeline and $1.04bn gas pipeline between the port city
of Kyaukpyu and Kunming in China. Thus, China's energy diplomacy is an important element of
the BRI strategy. Some Western and Indian analysts are worried about the “strings of pearls”
strategy pursued under the Maritime Silk Road Initiative of China. 
The ASEAN countries are very significant to China from the perspective of the BRI, because it
aims to connect the country with Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, Russia, and Europe by
land networks and Southeast Asia, South Asia, Oceania, and East African coastal regions via
maritime trade routes. 
China and India are also in a competitive race to get engaged in the economic and geo-strategic
landscapes of Myanmar. Note that China has a historic claim to India's northeastern border state
of Arunachal. At the same time, Myanmar's border regions are rich in natural resources such as
oil and gas. 
For instance, Rakhine is a borderland province having large oil and natural gas reserves, reaching
11 trillion and 23 cubic feet respectively. India has, however, shifted from its “Look East” to “Act
East” policy. The Look East Policy (LEP), which was launched in 1991 by the Narasimha Rao
Government, was part of the development paradigm of the new economic reforms in India. The
essence of India's LEP was to build on the stagnant diplomatic and trade relations with the South-
East Asian states, whereas the northeastern region was to facilitate as the gateway to these
countries. 
Global concern
Last but not the least, the international community could arrive at the central realization that the
presence of a large stateless population outside the country of origin can often lead to an
internationalization of conflict, and consequently pose a threat to regional and global security. 25/05/2025, 14:20 Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh: BRI perspective
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/296679/rohingya-refugee-crisis-in-bangladesh-bri 5/6Chinese leaders and officials often propagate the concept of a Chinese dream -- the dream of the
Chinese national greatness with a voice in the global leadership position. 
But, the dream of the peaceful development of China with its large-scale BRI mega-project
would remain merely “a dream” until and unless the Rohingya refugees-driven crucial issues on
illiteracy, poverty, human rights violations, illicit drug trade, organized crime, human trafficking,
violence, and underdevelopment are addressed properly and systematically.

Strategic plans to help implement BRI
China wants Bangladesh to play major role
Shahiduzzaman Khan Back From Beijing

Flurries of recent activities surrounding the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Beijing and
elsewhere in China demonstrate that some positive changes in the economies and lifestyles
in Asia and other parts of the region are in the offing. 
In 2013, China's President Xi Jinping floated the concept of ""Silk Road Economic Belt""
during his visit to Central and South East Asia, which later on was called the Belt and Road
Initiative. It was conceived to promote Chinese cooperation with Central Asia and South
East Asia in the field of trade, connectivity, culture and exchange. 
The BRI is aimed at providing other countries' access to China through railways and roads
via seaports to speed up economic growth. 
For Bangladesh, the initiative is likely to usher in a new era as the country will get needed
funds to bankroll its mega infrastructure projects. Its affiliation with the BRI has already
started bearing fruits as investment from China has accelerated. 
In the past, China's involvement in Bangladesh was largely limited to EPC (engineering,
procurement and construction) contractors and the country's investment was less than
$1.0 billion in 2015. Recently the two countries signed an agreement on a 1,320-megawatt
coal-fired power plant at Payra in Patuakhali involving $2.4 billion with both parties having
equal shares. 
A Chinese consortium, comprising the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Stock
Exchange, has bought 25 per cent stake of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, to become its
strategic partner -- a move that has brought in roughly $125 million in investment. BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/strategic-plans-to-help-implement-bri-1556682954 1/5Alipay, a concern of China's e-commerce and tech giant Alibaba Group, has bought 20 per
cent stake in bKash, Bangladesh's largest mobile financial service provider, in an
undisclosed amount of investment. 
Bangladesh can seize the opportunity to take in external borrowing from China, given its
low foreign debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio, which is now at 15 per cent. It can
relieve the pressure by allowing liberalised foreign currency loans. Besides, it needs to
develop the capital market, improve financial transparency further, raise the ease of doing
business ranking and ramp up exports. 
Even with the current growth rate, Bangladesh's economy would become a half-a-trillion
dollar economy within the next five years. It is really the prime time for Bangladesh to rise
up. 
There is no denying that China is the most populated country in the world and most of the
Asian countries, particularly the Southeast Asian economies, are dependent on China, as it
is a key trading partner of these nations. 
Since most of the Central Asian countries have small economies with lesser potential for
investment, the overland transportation becomes expensive as compared to shipments by
sea. China introduced a new idea of a maritime road which runs from the Chinese coast
through Southeast Asia to the Indian Ocean and then to Europe. 
The area covered by the BRI possesses 55 per cent of the world's gross national product
(GNP), 70 per cent of the global population and 75 per cent of the known energy reserves. It
has now become the main component of the regional economic strategy under the Chinese
foreign policy. 
Six economic corridors have been proposed under the BRI project by China. They include
the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor. Some Asian countries including India and
Japan are against the initiative and see it as a Chinese long-term Marshall Plan strategy to
gain geopolitical dominance in Asia and the Asia Pacific region. 
Analysts believe if the BRI is successfully implemented, it will give China more confidence in
reshaping the world order. As a result, the balance of technology and growth will drift
slowly and gradually towards Asia from Europe, says a study. 
Asia is densely populated and home to more than 2.8 billion people with its land fertile for
the IT and communication industry. It also has cheap labour and capital, rich in raw
resources and has the tremendous absorbing capacity for new technologies and
developments. All these factors will help improve the situation in favour of emerging Asian
countries and will probably tip the regional balance in favour of Asia. 
In the next two decades, the emerging Asian countries may stand out as the strongest
opponents to the US supremacy in Asia and the Asia Pacific region. The impact of the BRI
will help enhance the use of ICT in health, retail, security and business activities. It will also
contribute to promotion of the digital culture, namely e-government, e-business, e-
commerce, etc. 
Over the past five years, China's trade with countries along the Belt and Road route
exceeded USD 5.5 trillion. Chinese direct investment in the non-financial sectors of those
countries reached USD 80 billion. China founded 82 overseas economic and trade
cooperation zones in those countries, providing USD 8.9 billion worth of funds and thus
creating 244,000 jobs. 
Analysts say a mega project like the BRI will obviously face a lot of challenges and
limitations in its implementation. There is, in fact, a need for efficient and effective
management infrastructure to oversee and closely monitor its progress. The BRI is certainly
a good initiative. It requires effective communication and strategic plans to be
implemented successfully. 
As Bangladesh is a key maritime nation in an important geo-strategic location along the BRI
route, China wants it to play a major role in materialising the geo-economic and geo-25/05/2025, 11:27 Strategic plans to help implement BRI | The Financial Express

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/379207/dhaka-beijing-call-for-transforming-high-level 1/3Bangladesh and China on Sunday expressed a shared commitment to transforming recent high-
level discussions into actionable projects across a range of sectors, including infrastructure, trade,
healthcare, education, and culture.
“Our top priority now is to move forward with the plans we discussed during the China visit,”
said Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, when Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao
Wen met him at the State Guest House Jamuna to review the outcomes Yunus' recent visit to
China and outline next steps for accelerating Bangladesh-China cooperation.
“We want to make sure the momentum is not lost,” Chief Adviser’s Deputy Press Secretary
Apurba Jahangir quoted the chief adviser as saying.
The Chinese ambassador echoed the chief adviser’s sentiment, saying: “This is also our top
priority. We had one of the highest-level agenda meetings in China, and we do not want to wait
another two to three years just to sign agreements—we want to implement them quickly.”
One of the topics discussed was the development of the Mongla and Anowara economic zones.
BIDA Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun informed that preparations are
underway and, once completed, the zones will be handed over to developers to begin
implementation.
Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to launching a long-term, 50-year master plan on water
management, including work on the Teesta river system.
The two sides also discussed a plan to procure four new vessels from China, with the Chinese
side assuring that the process would be completed by June this year.
The Chinese ambassador also said that China’s commerce minister will visit Bangladesh soon,
accompanied by a 100-member delegation of investors aiming to explore new investment
opportunities.
“We will organise a mini investment summit focused on Chinese investors to strengthen sector-
specific collaboration,” said BIDA Chairman Ashik.
Healthcare cooperation featured prominently in the discussion.

initially proposed during the China visit. They also highlighted ongoing support in establishing a
specialised burn unit in Chittagong.
The ambassador informed that progress is being made to launch a direct Kunming–Chittagong
flight, and efforts are underway to expedite medical visas for Bangladeshi patients.
The chief adviser stressed the importance of cultural exchange, proposing the establishment of a
Chinese Cultural Centre and Language Institute to allow young Bangladeshis to engage more
closely with the Chinese language and culture.
The chief adviser also raised the possibility of expanding jute exports to China and urged greater
Chinese investment in the locomotive sector.
He proposed setting up locomotive manufacturing and maintenance hubs in both Chittagong and
Saidpur, alongside capacity-building workshops and training programs.
Agricultural trade was another area of progress. Bangladesh will begin exporting mangoes to
China this season, with jackfruit exports scheduled for next year.
“I will send a basket of fresh mangoes to President Xi myself,” said Yunus.
The meeting was also attended by Foreign Adviser Md Touhid Hossain, National Security
Adviser Dr Khalliur Rahman, BIDA Chairman Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun, Special Assistant Faiz
Ahmad Taieb, Cabinet Secretary Siraj Uddin Miah, and SDGs Affairs Principal Coordinator

relations with both global powers USA and China through its balanced foreign policy, though it is
a “challenging” task.
“That is a challenging thing. They (US, China) might have their own problems. That is their
headache, not ours. We want to maintain good relations with both,” he said.
Momen made the remarks when a reporter wanted to know how the Bangladesh government is
maintaining relations with the United States and China
The foreign minister referred to the historic quote of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, “Friendship to all, malice towards none”, which has recently been
incorporated in a UN General Assembly resolution. “We believe in this policy,” Momen said.
Momen received the newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang during the latter's brief
stopover at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport early today while US Senior Director for South
Asia, National Security Council, Rear Admiral Eileen Laubacher, wrapped up her four-day visit
to Bangladesh.
On the other hand, a delegation of the International Department of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), led by Vice Minister Chen Zhou, is currently visiting
Bangladesh to have interactions with Bangladesh leadership.
The CPC delegation is scheduled to leave Dhaka on January 11 while Donald Lu, who became
Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs on September 15,
2021, is likely to begin his Bangladesh visit on January 15.
Asked whether Bangladesh-US discussed the election issue during US official Laubacher's visit,
Momen said the next national election will be held after one year, and over the last 14 years,
elections were held in a free, fair manner. “Our country is a democratic country.”
He said the overall election environment can be improved through joint efforts domestically with
the participation of people and all parties.
Momen said it would be unfortunate if anyone violence occurs during elections and it cannot be
stopped by “recommendations from the outside. We have to do this.”

understand the global challenges better. This article published in the first issue
focuses on exploring the global power play in Bangladesh's elections. –   Mahfuz
Anam, Editor & Publisher 
The recent presidential election in the Maldives reflected a theatre for India-
China competition, with the president-elect, Mohamed Muiz, making ""India out""
a central theme in his campaign. We also witnessed the two major powers
jockeying for influence in the Nepalese election in 2022. While the political
landscape in Bangladesh differs from that of its two South Asian neighbours, the
India-China contest remains a crucial factor. Over the course of the past 15 years,
both countries have deepened their stakes in Bangladesh, which is clearly evident
in the growing geopolitical tension surrounding the upcoming election.
China is now Bangladesh's largest trade partner, with bilateral trade currently
valued at $25 billion. Since joining China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2016,
China has committed over $38 billion in investments to Bangladesh. The country
is second among all sources of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Bangladesh.
Furthermore, during the current regime's tenure, China-Bangladesh defence
cooperation has reached unprecedented levels. China has maintained its position
as the chief supplier of light weapons to Bangladesh since the 1970s, with over 70
percent of Bangladesh's weapons procurement between 2015 and 2022 originating
from China, according to SIPRI. Notably, China has been instrumental in the
construction of Bangladesh's first submarine base, the BNS Sheikh Hasina, with a
total investment of $1.2 billion, located in Pekua within Cox's Bazaar.
China's approach to Bangladesh during the ruling Awami League's regime can be
summarised as bolstering economic ties while refraining from criticising
democratic backsliding in the country. China was the first country to welcome the
AL government after the one-sided 2014 elections, and it didn't hesitate to
congratulate them on their big win in the equally controversial 2018 elections.
Furthermore, unlike economic aid from the US and Europe, Chinese investments
in Bangladesh's infrastructure come without conditions related to human rights,
good governance, or democracy. As a result, this has allowed the AL government
to lessen its dependence on Western donors.
Regarding the forthcoming election, China has consistently adhered to a stance
that aligns with its overarching strategy, as aptly articulated by Chinese
Ambassador to Bangladesh, Yao Wen, who stated, ""Our policy always remains the
same. China never intervenes in other country's internal issues. I can say the
election is the internal affairs of Bangladesh. It has to be decided by the
Bangladesh people.""
China also opposes any external pressure exerted by the United States concerning
the election. This stance is endorsed at the highest level of Chinese leadership. On
August 23, 2023, during a meeting with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on the
sidelines of the BRICS summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated, according to a
readout from China's foreign ministry, that China supports Bangladesh in
""opposing external interference"" and that Beijing will collaborate with Dhaka to
mutually support their core interests.
In the upcoming election, if the ruling party emerges victorious, Chinese
influence may strengthen even further. Conversely, if the AL loses, and the
opposition BNP comes to power, there is relatively minimal risk for China to lose
its stake, given the historically favourable relations between BNP and China.
Now, let's delve deeper into India's interests in Bangladesh's upcoming election.
As its largest neighbour, India undeniably holds a substantial stake in the
electoral proceedings. The increasing asymmetrical power dynamics between
these two nations have brought this influence into sharper focus.
In his book titled ""1971-2021: Bangladesh-Bharat Shomporker Ponchash
Bochor"" (1971-2021: 50 years of Bangladesh-India relations), former Bangladeshi
Foreign Secretary Touhid Hossain has shed light on the nature of the deepening
political reliance on India. He articulates, ""It is widely believed that no one can
ascend to the throne of Bangladesh without India's approval. Statements
supporting this notion have emanated from senior political figures on occasion.
Many believe that India's consent is a prerequisite for appointments to key
positions within Bangladesh. India's direct involvement in legitimising the 2014
election is well-documented. It was so apparent that even the leaders of the
political party (the BNP), whose political foundation is rooted in anti-Indianism,
had to reach out to India in an attempt to gain favour ahead of the 2018 election,
although their endeavours ultimately yielded no success.""
India's growing influence has fostered stronger bilateral ties with the AL-led
Bangladesh government, characterised by terms like ""very special relationship,""
""golden chapter,"" and ""model for the entire region."" The AL government has
addressed India's security concerns, particularly access to northeastern India,
through connectivity projects and action against anti-India insurgent groups. In
return, India has steadfastly supported the AL government, overlooking
democratic setbacks in Bangladesh. As regards the upcoming election, a
significant portion of the Indian media and think tanks continue to advocate
support for the current regime.
Nevertheless, some experts believe that India has adopted a different stance
towards the 2024 elections.
Indicating this changed position, Indian columnist Arkoprabho Hazra wrote
in The Diplomat, ""India is taking a much more inclusive approach toward the
2024 Bangladesh national elections, rather than putting all its bets on the Awami
League as seen in the past.""
He emphasised that India has expressed interest in ensuring violence-free and
democratic national elections in Bangladesh, aligning with the US stance. Recent
discussions between Indian and US security establishments suggest, according to
Hazra, a potential collaborative effort on election issues. This marks a departure
from the 2018 elections when India and the US held divergent views.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Modi's swift congratulations to Prime Minister
Hasina for her victory helped alleviate international criticism of the election's
conduct.
Yet it is worth noting that India has refrained from publicly responding to the
growing pressure exerted by the United States on Bangladesh, including visa
measures, aimed at ensuring a free, fair, and participatory election.
Professor Ali Riaz offers three possible explanations for India's deliberate silence:
""Firstly, India may be comfortable with the existing political status quo, as
demonstrated by its tacit support for Prime Minister Hasina amid US concerns
about democratic erosion. Secondly, India might not oppose US pressure on
Bangladesh, recognising that it could make Hasina more dependent on India as a
mediator between her government and the United States. Lastly, India seems to
acknowledge its diminishing role in Bangladeshi politics amid the US-China
geopolitical rivalry, making it a secondary external actor in the region.""
Regardless of the reasons behind India's muted response, it's evident that the US
has shifted its perspective away from viewing the Bangladesh issue solely through
the Indian lens. Instead, its emphasis on promoting democracy in Bangladesh,
primarily driven by the aim to counteract China's growing influence in the
country, will significantly influence India's stance on the 2024 elections in
Bangladesh.
India finds itself in a complex and delicate position. There is unease over
Bangladesh's growing reliance on China for economic aid and infrastructure
development, at times straining the India-Bangladesh relationship. Additionally,
there is apprehension that excessive pressure from the US on election-related
matters could lead Bangladesh closer to China.
However, Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Centre's South Asia Institute,
suggested in an interview with Prothom Alo that the US believes India, by
leveraging its influence over Bangladesh, can steer it away from such an
alignment. Furthermore, the current regime in Bangladesh expects India to
advocate for Sheikh Hasina's government with the Biden administration.
India's response to these competing interests will be a pivotal factor in the
upcoming elections, the outcome of which carries significant implications not
only for Bangladesh but also for the Bay of Bengal region, a critical component of
the global geopolitical hotspot, the Indo-Pacific.

ANM Muniruzzaman on Thursday said Bangladesh needs to remain very careful about keeping
its national interest protected as strategic landscape in the Asia Pacific region is rapidly changing.
""Strategic landscape is changing rapidly. We need to observe it very carefully,"" he said while
addressing a virtual dialogue titled “Bangladesh-China Development Cooperation: Experience
and Outlook”.
""Don't become part of military agreements or soft military agreements. We should be very careful
in maintaining our status,"" he said mentioning recent agreement between India and the United
States.
He put emphasis on maintaining strategic autonomy which is fundamental to maintaining
economic autonomy or economic freedom with competitiveness.
""We, as a first tract developing country, need to have strategic autonomy so that we have
economic freedom to cooperate with everybody,"" Muniruzzaman said.
He said Bangladesh is a signatory of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and at the same time
Bangladesh believes in the principles of Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS).
""We want to remain active part of the BRI and at the same time we want to cooperate with the
IPS,"" Muniruzzaman said emphasizing taking maximum advantage of both the initiatives for
national interest.

He said Bangladesh has to be extremely cautious in navigating the new complex world avoiding

He said Bangladesh needs to have the capacity to negotiate a good and affordable price of the
vaccine which comes out first in the market.

China also said as a ""good neighbour, partner and friend"" of South Asian countries, it is ready to

adversities, he said.
Wang Yi said that in March this year, President Xi Jinping sent a video message to an event

Syed Badrul Ahsan
Update : 09 Ma y 2019, 12:03 AM
Now that the government has made clear its intention to be associated with China’s Belt and
Road Initiative, it will need to reconfigure the nation’s foreign policy in line with its new
priorities.

xx25/05/2025, 15:05 Our diplomats need to do better
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/176319/our-diplomats-need-to-do-better 1/5The election of December last year is five months behind us, which is as good a time as any for
an administration to formulate its diplomatic objectives in the new term of office it becomes
privy to. For Bangladesh, the link with BRI -- and this was made known a couple of weeks ago
by the international affairs advisor to the prime minister -- is a step toward closer cooperation
with China in light of the strategic importance Dhaka holds in the region.
But the BRI move also entails -- and this is what the mandarins at the foreign office, walking a
tightrope as they do where traditional links with India are concerned, realize -- some major
concerns. Obviously, Delhi could not have been pleased with Dhaka’s new leanings toward
Beijing. But the BRI step is one which diplomacy on Bangladesh’s part will need to project
forcefully and meaningfully as a mark of the balance it intends to bring into its ties with its
neighbours. 
That balance, however, should be based on a realistic assessment of the BRI idea, given that
warnings about the debt trap, into which nations like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, the Maldives, Djibouti,
and a host of others have fallen, have already been sounded. The Sri Lankans have, for want of
repayment money, handed over Hambantota port to the Chinese. The Pakistanis do not say it, but
the fact is that Gwadar port in Balochistan is to all intents and purposes in Chinese control. 
A silver lining for Bangladesh in its Chinese dealings has been the Sonadia affair, a project Dhaka
eventually did not agree to be financed by Beijing. It is a position which, in terms of foreign
policy formulations, ought to be upheld by Dhaka even as it joins the BRI process. How it will do
that is a challenge for the nation’s diplomacy in much the same way that a resolution of the Teesta

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/176319/our-diplomats-need-to-do-better 2/5waters issue with India is a hurdle the country will need to leap across during the government’s
new term in office. 
Bangladesh’s great disappointment has been to experience the inability, despite its initial
optimism, of the Narendra Modi government to arrive at a resolution of the dilemma with Sheikh
Hasina’s government. Now that the general elections in India are drawing to a close -- and one is
not quite sure if the BJP-led government will return to office or a coalition of secular parties will
be in a position to stake a claim to forming a new government once the results of the vote become
known -- it should be for Dhaka’s diplomatic establishment to prepare position papers on the
Teesta it can logically and convincingly present across the table, as it engages in new negotiations
with Delhi. 
Smart diplomacy is called for across a wide swath of foreign policy perspectives. An assertive
approach to dealing with Pakistan, incorporating the fundamental issue of an apology by
Islamabad over the atrocities committed by its soldiers in 1971, is in order. 
But with that must come a more comprehensive position on the 1971 issue, the precedent here
being the pressure which was applied on post-war Germany and Japan for a repudiation of their
past. Nazism has been condemned by successive generations of post-war German leaders;
Japanese militarism of the 1930s and 1940s is taboo for the country’s politicians. 
For Bangladesh, therefore, the Pakistan issue should go beyond the demand for an apology. For
the government, there is a clear need to press Islamabad to come forth with clear explanations for
Pakistanis of the causes behind the genocide committed in Bangladesh and at the same time,
demand that the misleading and false teaching about 1971 imparted to Pakistani school-children
in their textbooks be removed and the realities incorporated there. 
Generations of Pakistani children have, since the emergence of Bangladesh, grown to adulthood
through being fed stories of “conspiracies” by Bengali politicians and India behind the loss of
East Pakistan in 1971.
In short, while Pakistan must publicly repent its actions in 1971, it should also have all those
offending chapters removed from the history textbooks its children study in schools. For far too
long, our diplomacy has rested on a ritual mouthing of platitudes. That should change, in terms of
relations with the wider world.
With common interests as also issues which call for bilateral deliberations being in the picture,
efforts should be expended in formulating strategies for official state visits by the prime minister
to such Western capitals as London and Washington. The clear objective behind summitry
involving Bangladesh’s leader and government leaders in the West will not merely be publicxx25/05/2025, 15:05 Our diplomats need to do better

the global scheme of things. 
The Rohingya issue should have been a good reason for the prime minister to undertake
meaningful tours of the West and East and South-East Asia to persuade the political classes in
these regions into spurring their efforts to have Myanmar agree to take its people back on well-
defined terms in line with international law. 
Indira Gandhi provided a huge impetus to the Bangladesh cause on her global tours in 1971. That
was diplomacy at its height.
Much a similar approach should now underpin Bangladesh’s diplomacy, through providing scope
to Sheikh Hasina to argue her case vis-à-vis Rohingyas in person before the councils of the
world. Diplomacy is an opening of windows to the world.It is a measure of the expertise
diplomats can bring into its formulation and practice. Besides, in large measure, policy-makers in
a nation’s diplomatic arena are always ready to benefit from the wisdom of their predecessors. 
To what extent has the foreign office at Shegun Bagicha profited, if at all, from those who have
been there before, if at all they have been approached for snippets of their wisdom?
With the foreign office being led by the minister for foreign affairs and the minister of state for
foreign affairs, and with the prime minister’s advisor on international affairs holding the fort at
the PMO, a thorough and goals-oriented recasting of Bangladesh’s diplomacy is called for.

China has gained popularity in Bangladesh through offering development-finance aid

However the research report, titled 'Belt and Road Reboot: Beijing's bid to De-risk Global
Infrastructure Initiative', says in a footnote that gradually the public-approval rating is
declining.BN
25/05/2025, 11:32 How Chinese aid advances BD dev, gains soft power | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/how-chinese-aid-advances-bd-dev-gains-soft-power 1/7During the early BRI period, China made modest media-sentiment gains in Bangladesh at
the expense of western countries like the US and the UK.
According to survey of the institute, public-approval rating in Bangladesh for China was 49
per cent between 2006 and 2013 and then it rose to 60 per cent in 2014-2018 period and
came down to 50 per cent in 2019 -2022 period.
China dramatically increased aid credit to Bangladesh during the late BRI period as annual
aid and credit commitments from Beijing to Dhaka was only $994 million between 2014 and
2017 but this figure soared to US$ 3.4 billion between 2018 and 2021, reads the report
released Tuesday by the William and Mary Global Research Institute.
This ""unprecedented increase in spending coincided with a period of political stability"", the
report notes.
Between March 1971 and December 2008 Bangladesh's largest foreign aid and credit
providers were Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom. China did not maintain
aid, especially large development finance programme, during this period. However, during
the BR era, Beijing issued grant and loan commitments worth $17.5 billion, making it to the
""single-largest development partner"" of the country.
In 2006, China also surpassed India and the US to become Bangladesh's largest trading
partner with $4.7 billion trade flow.
""One might assume that the combination of high trade volumes and unprecedented levels
of aid and credit for highly visible infrastructure projects led to rapid soft power
accumulation for China. However, in reality the relationship between developed and
financial-support power has not been straightforward for several reasons,"" the report says.
According to the report, China's grant and loan commitments worth 20.8 billion US dollars
for 138 projects in Bangladesh between 2000 and 2021 made the country one of China's 20
largest aid and credit recipients in the developing world and seventh- largest recipient in
Asia.
China ODA and official finance commitments to the country soared from US$3.3 billion
during the pre-BRI period, that is, from 2000 to 2013, to US$17.5 billion during the early and
late BRI periods from 2014 to 2021.
The BRI project portfolio was largely focused on the construction and rehabilitation of
power plants' transmission lines and bridges.25/05/2025, 11:32 How Chinese aid advances BD dev, gains soft power | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/how-chinese-aid-advances-bd-dev-gains-soft-power 2/7""Given the unprecedented scale of this financial commitments and the highly visible nature
of the infrastructure projects undertaken during the BRI, it is not surprising that building
has made some public opinion and media-sentiment gains,"" the report says.
In recent years, China credits to Bangladesh mainly focused on bankable infrastructure.
Beijing in recent years issued loan worth $697 million for a fertiliser factory and US$595
million for 3G mobile and national Internet broadband network up-gradation, power plants
and an open-water treatment plant.
According to the research finding, the conventional wisdom that China dramatically scaled
back its overseas lending commitments during the late period due to the Covid-19
pandemic and rising concerns about debt sustainability does not match in case of
Bangladesh because during this period Beijing provided US$2.3 billion per year in new ODA
aid, which enabled the country the rapid completion of high-profile projects such as Padma
bridge, elevated expressway and several power plants.
""In the six-month period leading up to the December 2018 election Beijing approved $6.8-
billion loan for big projects including the 1320MW Bashkhali coal-fired power plant which
was financed by five Chinese creditors and one local creditor, Rupali Bank, through a
US$1.78 billion syndicated loan,"" the report mentions, pointing out China's seriousness in
helping the government in carrying out its development drives.
""During the same six-month period, Chinese state-owned companies began the
implementation of six additional projects backed by financial commitments worth US$6.5
billion, including the 1320MW coal-fired power plant and the high-profile Padma bridge rail-
link project,"" it says.

Last update on: Wed Mar 12, 2025 01:31 AM
Says Chinese ambassador
China wants to see stability, unity, and democracy flourish in Bangladesh under
the leadership of Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus, said Chinese Ambassador
to Bangladesh Yao Wen yesterday.

Yao Wen also emphasised that China stands with Bangladesh and its people, not
any particular government.
""Regardless of changes in the international or domestic landscape, China remains
Bangladesh's partner. Our cooperation benefits both nations,"" he said.

Bangladesh, China will work closer than ever
He made the remarks while speaking at a seminar titled ""National Image of China
in Bangladesh"" organised by the Center for Alternatives (CA) at a hotel in the
capital.
Regarding the chief adviser's visit to China from March 26-29, Wen said China
invites all heads of government but could not comment on visit priorities.
At the programme, CA Executive Director Prof Imtiaz Ahmed presented a 2024
survey showing that 99 percent of respondents support China-Bangladesh
friendly relations.

Positive perceptions of China in Bangladesh rose to 66.7 percent in 2024 from 60.1
percent in 2022, while 85 percent recognised China's economic and technological
progress, up from 50 percent in 2022, he said.
Referring to the data, Yao Wen said Bangladeshis view Chinese investment and
bilateral cooperation in national development and poverty alleviation positively,
boosting China's confidence in strengthening the Bangladesh-China strategic
partnership.

He also said the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries
presents opportunities to strengthen cooperation in healthcare, education, trade,
and culture.
On the Rohingya crisis, Yao Wen said China mediated, but efforts stalled due to
Myanmar's worsening security situation.
Then Prof Imtiaz Ahmed said China should initiate a development plan for
Rakhine State to create conditions for Rohingya repatriation.
Dhaka University Prof Dr Rashed Al Mahmud Titumir said China's poverty
reduction model could be a case study for Bangladesh.
Former diplomat Mashfee Binte Shams urged China to play a larger role in
resolving the Rohingya crisis while avoiding debt-trap concerns.
Retired Prof Amena Mohsin and independent researcher Syed Shahnzwaz Mohsin
also spoke at the event.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/259907/chinese-envoy-will-draw-more-chinese-investors-to 1/4China will work to promote business opportunities in Bangladesh and improve the
business environment to attract more Chinese enterprises, said the Chinese Ambassador to
Bangladesh Li Jimming on Tuesday.
The second largest economy in the world will also enhance the interests to protect its investors,
adding that they will do so in Bangladesh with the help of all relevant government agencies like
Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (Bida), Bangladesh Export Processing Zones
Authority (Bepza), Bangladesh Economy Zones Authority (Beza), and others with prominent
business associations like FBCCI and so on.
He made the remarks during a virtual conference on China-Bangladesh Economic and Trade
Cooperation Forum 2021 and the Inauguration of the seventh council of Chinese Enterprises
Association in Bangladesh (Ceab) on the day.
The Chinese envoy also said that Bangladesh is the first South Asian country to join the Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI).

“Currently a number of major BRI projects are rooted in Bangladesh, with some key cooperation
projects being launched. China encourages Chinese enterprises to strengthen exchanges and
cooperation with the business community of Bangladesh, especially in the manufacturing sector
to accelerate the green and low-carbon transformation,” he added.
He also said that they are striving to achieve their carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by
2060. China will also strongly support Bangladesh's green and low-carbon energy development.
“China will no longer build coal and power projects in Bangladesh. Chinese and Bangladeshi
enterprises should actively explore and strive for new breakthroughs to promote Sino-Bangladesh
economic and trade cooperation to a broader field and a deeper level,” he added.
Jimming also said that from January to July 2021, the trade volume between China and
Bangladesh reached $13 billion, up 58.9% year on year.
The contracted turnover of projects of the Chinese enterprises in Bangladesh was $3.18 billion,
up 59.5% year on year while Chinese direct investment in Bangladesh was $418 million, up

Bangladesh is expected to graduate from the LDCs by 2026 and could be among the world's top
25 economies by 2030. The bilateral relations have developed smoothly and economic and trade
cooperation has been remarkable between China and Bangladesh, he added in his speech as
special guest at the program.
Prime minister’s private industry and investment adviser Salman F Rahman attended the program
as chief guest.
He congratulated the newly-elected president and other members of the seventh Ceab council.

He hoped that Ceab will play a very important and constructive role for making a closer and
stronger relationship for the two business communities of China and Bangladesh.
Rahman urged the Chinese businesses to take part in the Bangladesh Investment Summit, slated
to be held in November.
He also agreed with the Chinese envoy to strengthen cooperation between the two countries and
was willing to sign a government-to-government and public private partnership deal with China
immediately, to further deepen the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.
Ke Changliang, president of the Ceab, said that the Ceab members work in Bangladesh for long-
term development while actively fulfilling their social responsibilities and making positive
contributions to the economic development of Bangladesh.
“As the largest Chinese association in Bangladesh, Ceab will continue to perform service
functions, strengthen close ties with Bangladesh business, guide Chinese enterprises in
Bangladesh to keep foothold in Bangladesh, make contributions to Bangladesh in the post-Covid-
19 pandemic era for greater development in economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries,” he added.

https://bdnews24.com/opinion/g84m0xui4m 1/10Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi at a dinner hosted by South African President Cyril
Ramaphosa in Johannesburg.
Published :  01 Sep 2023, 01:27 AM

Not many South Asian leaders command New Delhi’ s respect and warmth as much as Bangladesh Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina. For years, she has been a loyal and trusted-neighbourhood ally even as others in
the sub- continent have chosen to drift away towards China. But this allegiance has now undergone a not-
so-subtle change. It is not that Delhi-Dhaka diplomatic relations have turned frosty . Neither is there any
obvious chill.
As Bangladesh heads for general elections in January 2024 -- the polls could be advanced by a month just
as they were last time -- the country is abuzz with the gaggle for just what degree of “free and fair”
measures would be allowed by the incumbent Awami League in the already charged atmosphere.
Powerful global and regional players have also jumped onto the bandwagon with the United States insisting
-- even more strongly than the last time in 2018 -- that Sheikh Hasina creates conditions for free and fair
elections and not repeat the “farce” of five years ago. India’ s voice remains muted, though it will certainly
play a big role and manoeuvre as much as it can. On their part, the Chinese have made it rather clear who
they want to put their money on. Over the past 10-12 months, there have been a series of visits in quick
succession by senior Chinese functionaries to Dhaka.

https://bdnews24.com/opinion/g84m0xui4m 2/10But what about Dhaka? The brush meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Hasina at
the Johannesburg BRICS summit in the third week of August was exactly what it was: a brief brush
between two seeming friends. On the other hand, Hasina had a closed-door meeting with Chinese
President Xi Jinping. This, by and in itself, was significant.

South Africa on W ednesday , Aug 23, 2023. Photo: BSS
While Hasina was in Johannesburg, her Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen left his other cabinet colleagues
and many in Dhaka’ s political circles and policy wonks astonished and stunned by telling a TV news
channel that Xi Jinping told Hasina that “China will fulfil her dream of a golden Bengal, an economically
strong Bangladesh”.×

https://bdnews24.com/opinion/g84m0xui4m 3/10Consulting, every now and then, a written brief held firmly in his hand, Momen continued to elaborate on
the rosy economic and developmental “synergy” that China wants to unfold and usher in Bangladesh.
There was more: he said Hasina sang paeans of the opportunities that have come Dhaka’ s way since the
country joined the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). “But Bangladesh’ s needs are much more,” he
quoted Hasina having told Xi. Hasina, according to Momen, wanted to “expedite” a Bangladesh-China free
trade agreement.
This has certainly left the Indian foreign policy establishment stoney-faced and impassive, indicating the
stunning ef fect these revelations have had on South Block and the pace at which Dhaka was willing to rush
to court Beijing. Meanwhile, senior Awami League sources said while the US and the rest of the W estern
bloc are “adamant” and “continue to keep up pressure on Dhaka to ensure free and fair elections,” New
Delhi has conveyed to the Awami League leadership to not “pursue seeking the re-election of five important
and a few other middling ministers in Hasina’ s government who enjoy strong Chinese support.” Indeed,
these sources said that the W estern bloc, including the US, seek to play a role “far stronger than India” in
shaping the road for relatively free and fair elections in Bangladesh.
But, Awami League sources said, Hasina may not play ball with India and not agree to drop five powerful
ministers, including an adviser to Hasina who holds cabinet rank, when she comes visiting on Sept 8 to×

https://bdnews24.com/opinion/g84m0xui4m 4/10attend the G-20 summit in New Delhi. This would be an open defiance of New Delhi whose foreign policy
and security establishments have always routinely “tailored” and “vetted” the list of potential Awami League
election candidates in the past.
If Hasina decides to disregard India’ s stand and choose to continue with the “tainted five”, it would signal
something more ominous than even the progressively strong China-Bangladesh economic dalliance. It
would mean a deep Chinese penetration of India’ s only political ally in Bangladesh and consequently loss
of control over Dhaka.
However , the only concession that the Awami League government is likely to make is to partially reduce the
level of repression on opposition party leaders, cadres and supporters. This time around, there are few
reports of “disappearance” of opposition party cadres. In fact, the Hasina administration’ s police and
security establishment has begun allowing opposition political rallies for which a large number of people
from dif ferent parts of Bangladesh have been gathering in Dhaka even as anti-India sentiments have
deepened and widened.
The Indian establishment is not interested in the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP),
which took part in the 2018 general elections as part of a coalition of political forces under the banner of the
Oikkyo Jote (Combined Alliance) under the leadership of the Sheikh Mujib loyalist and erstwhile Awami
League minister Kamal Hossain.
Last time, the BNP  leadership had taken desperate measures to reach out to key Indian functionaries in
Delhi. But the moves were rebuf fed and the delegation was met with unconcealed coldness, if not complete
hostility for the party’ s past record of being “anti-India” and for being partners with regressive forces such
as the Jamaat-e-Islami. This time, the BNP , which has been holding political rallies in Dhaka and×

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bd-china-strategic-cooperation-helpful-for-prosperity-in-asia-beyond-1562423995 1/7between the two nations, said an official.
Bangladesh and China established the strategic partnership of cooperation in 2016 during
Xi's historic state visit to Bangladesh, as per a UNB report.
""Bangladesh-China relationship is flourishing and it'll go even stronger,"" said Dr Ruan
Zongze, Executive Vice President of China Institute of International Studies (CIIS) adding
that there are numerous synergies and two countries need to work together for a better
future.
Principal Research Fellow of the Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS), National University
of Singapore, former foreign affairs adviser Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury also termed the
visit very import one not only in terms of bilateral relations but also from a regional
perspective.
""Bangladesh-China relations are strong of course but it's going to be stronger because of
huge Chinese investment in infrastructural development partly because of the BRI (Belt and
Road Initiative) and also because purely on bilateral terms,"" he told the agency.
The Prime Minister, who returned home on Saturday concluding her five-day official visit to
China, will brief the media on Monday afternoon about the outcomes of her just-concluded
visit.
On Thursday, Bangladesh and China signed nine instruments for further strengthening
cooperation on power, water resources, culture and tourism sectors as well as providing
2,500 metric tonnes of rice for the displaced Rohingyas.
The instruments, including two loan deals, were signed in presence of Bangladesh Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang after a bilateral meeting between
the two leaders at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
On Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing and said the elevation of bilateral ties has helped
promote cooperation between the two countries to a new phase of fast development, inject
impetus into the economic and social development in both countries, and bring more
benefits to both peoples.
He called on both countries to carry forward the traditional friendship and jointly promote
cooperative and common development of two countries.

Bangladesh needs a cohesive policy framework to harness BRI's potential fully and engage
in projects that align with national development goals, said a new report launched in
Dhaka on Thursday evening.
The report said the focus for Bangladesh should be on boosting economic activities and
facilitating technology transfers as the China-designed ʻBelt and Road Initiativeʼ has drawn
attention globally with Bangladesh considering options for its share in the plan, UNB
reports.
 ""By strategically leveraging BRI opportunities, Bangladesh can pave the way for
transformative and sustainable economic development, addressing challenges with
strategic planning and effective implementation,"" the report said.
The report titled ""The Belt and Road Initiative in Bangladesh: Achievements and Way
Forward"" in its executive summary laid emphasis on improving business environment with
upgradation of power, transportation, and logistics to attract private investments.
To maximise the benefits of the BRI, the report said, Bangladesh should focus on
infrastructure and economic activities.
Bangladesh should prioritise infrastructure development like roads, railways, and energy
facilities to attract foreign investment and enhance trade competitiveness and efficiency.
Education Minister Dr Dipu Moni joined as the chief guest while Chinese Ambassador to
Bangladesh Yao Wen, among others, was also present during the report launch.BN

Prime Ministerʼs adviser for international affairs Gowher Rizvi has said Bangladesh has
welcomed Chinaʼs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as it 'fits into our national priorities'.
He made the remarks at the launching ceremony of a Chinese publication by private think-
tank Center for East Asia Foundation (CEAF) in Dhaka on Saturday.
“Bangladesh is proud to be a part of this initiative,” he said, ahead of the BRI Summit in
Beijing next week.
Bangladesh joined the BRI during Chinese President Xi Jinpingʼs visit to Dhaka in October
2016. The initiative aims to rebuild the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and
beyond through massive infrastructural spending.
Dhaka is also sending a high-profile delegation, including the Minister for Industries Nurul
Majid Mahmud Humayun and the prime ministerʼs daughter Saima Wazed Hossain, to the
summit which will be held between April 25 and April 28.
However, the initiative has been the subject of controversy in many Western capitals,
particularly Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence
abroad and trap countries into debt through “nontransparent” projects.
India also opted against joining the BRI citing concerns over Chinaʼs projects with Pakistan.
Some analysts say India is not comfortable with Bangladeshʼs joining the initiative.
But the prime ministerʼs adviser did not respond to a question on the matter at the launch
of the ʻThe Belt and Roadʼ magazine.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bd-welcomes-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-gowher-rizvi-1555750576 1/5In his speech, bdnews24.com reports, he said Bangladesh had been in favour of the
initiative even before its announcement.
“We had our own BCIM (Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar Economic Corridor) which
is essentially a reduced version of the Belt and Road Initiative,” he said.
“Bangladesh is extremely successful in managing its foreign relations,” added Gowher.
“It has always avoided taking sides,” he said, referring to the foreign policy dictum
ʻfriendship to all, malice to noneʼ.
He continued: “Weʼll continue to maintain that. If you look objectively, today Bangladeshʼs
foreign policy has had spectacular success through its ability to maintain outstanding
relations with China, India, Japan, Soviet Union, United States and western European
countries.”
Gowher said this has helped Bangladesh to become what it is today. “Bangladesh has
become a model of development and innovation.”

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/312508/shahriar-nothing-to-share-yet-regarding-china’s 1/3State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam on Wednesday said the China-led Global
Development Initiative (GDI) is a new phenomenon and there is nothing to share until something
is done from the Bangladesh side.
There is a committee in place that will look into it, he said while responding to a question at an
interactive session held in a hotel in Dhaka.
""We are yet to reach any such stage regarding GDI.""
The Daily Ittefaq hosted the conversation with the state minister. The Daily Ittefaq Executive
Director and Publisher Tareen Hossain delivered the welcome remarks.
Shahriar said Bangladesh joined the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and it has no concerns about
the BRI.
Responding to another question, he said there is no reason to see new sanctions.
He also said the government is absolutely not under any pressure from anywhere.
Regarding a political question, he said a free and fair election requires equal political
commitments from all political parties.
Shahriar hoped that all political parties will take part in the election demonstrating their
commitment.
On the Rohingya crisis, he said the government is doing its best, seeking cooperation from the
major countries to resolve the issue.
Responding to a query, the state minister said there is no security threat in the country and
security cooperation does not mean joining any alliance.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/324751/china-bri-will-take-dhaka-beijing-relations-to 1/3Beijing-Dhaka relations will “surely reach a new height and open a new era of friendly
cooperation” under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Yan Hualong, chargé d'affaires of the
Chinese Embassy, has said.
He was speaking at the inauguration of the ""The Belt and Road Initiative in Bangladesh
Exhibition 2023"" in Dhaka on Friday. Lokman Hossain Miah, executive chairman of the
Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, was also present.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of BRI.
The envoy said Bangladesh had been the first country in South Asia to join the initiative.
He said the Chinese Embassy in Bangladesh was holding the exhibition to vividly demonstrate
the achievements of BRI in Bangladesh, build a platform for cooperation between Chinese and
Bangladeshi companies and present a gift on the upcoming 74th anniversary of the People's
Republic of China.
The exhibitors include 15 Chinese companies whose South Asian regional headquarters are in
Bangladesh, nearly 20 other large Chinese companies that are deeply operating in the Bangladesh
market, and several large Bangladeshi companies and banks.
Yan said economic and trade cooperation had always been an “important pillar of the China-
Bangladesh strategic partnership.”
Since Bangladesh joined the Belt and Road Initiative, more and more Chinese companies had
been investing in Bangladesh, he said.
Currently, there are more than 670 Chinese companies operating in Bangladesh.
These companies, “especially the exhibitors here today,” were an important driving force for
China-Bangladesh economic and trade cooperation, the envoy said.
“They promote more Chinese capital, Chinese technology and Chinese standards to Bangladesh,
providing impetus for the upgrading of Bangladesh's industrial structure and long-term economic
development.
“They build infrastructures such as roads and bridges, laying a solid foundation for Bangladesh's
economic development. They participate in municipal water affairs, dealing with garbage and

“They are committed to promoting bilateral trade and make positive contributions to
Bangladesh's import of raw materials sectors and export of finished products sector,” he said. 
On the journey of Bangladesh's modernization, Yan Hualong said, China would always be a
“trustworthy neighbour, close friend and cooperative partner.”
“China will continue to encourage more Chinese enterprises to invest in Bangladesh and promote
the steady and long-term development of China-Bangladesh economic and trade relations,” he
said.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/376454/chinese-solar-panel-giant-longi-to-invest-in 1/4Longi, the world’s largest solar panel manufacturer, has decided to set up an office and invest in
solar panel production in Bangladesh, Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen announced
on Sunday.
The ambassador said several top Chinese solar panel manufacturers visited Bangladesh in
December to explore investment opportunities.
This visit followed an invitation from Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, who had urged
Chinese companies to relocate their manufacturing plants to Bangladesh as part of the interim
government’s vision to turn the country into an economic hub.
Among the companies that visited, at least two firms, including Longi, have confirmed plans to
establish offices and factories in Bangladesh.
“They will invest in Bangladesh very soon,” Yao Wen told Yunus during a meeting at the State
Guest House Jamuna.
The ambassador said that since August 5—when Sheikh Hasina’s autocratic regime was ousted—
Chinese firms have emerged as the largest investors in Bangladesh.
He added that dozens of Chinese companies are now preparing to invest, especially with a
dedicated Chinese export processing zone expected to become operational soon. 
Yao Wen also highlighted the significance of Yunus’s upcoming visit to China, calling it the most
important in the 50-year-long relationship between the two “trustworthy and close friends.”

manufacturing hub for companies looking to export goods to Western markets.
He also encouraged Chinese hospital chains to establish top-tier clinics or form joint ventures
with Bangladeshi healthcare providers.
“Bangladesh needs massive investment in healthcare. Chinese hospital chains now have a unique
opportunity to build hospitals here,” he said.
In response, Yao Wen said China has dedicated four hospitals in Kunming to serve Bangladeshi
patients.
A group of Bangladeshis recently traveled there for treatment.
During Yunus’s visit to China, Peking University—one of the world’s leading educational
institutions—will confer an honorary doctorate upon him. He is also scheduled to deliver a
speech at the university. 
The trip marks his first bilateral foreign visit as chief adviser.
He will attend and speak at the Boao Forum, often called the “Davos of the East,” where global
leaders and CEOs gather annually to discuss major global issues.
His speech will focus on Asia in a changing world, with China's executive vice premier joining
him in the session.
On March 28, the Chief Adviser is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the two
nations will issue a joint statement following their discussions.

China hopeful about Teesta project after
national elections: envoy
Thu Dec 21, 2023 09:54 PM
Last update on: Thu Dec 21, 2023 10:26 PM
China is hopeful about starting the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and
Restoration Project after the national elections, said Chinese Ambassador to
Bangladesh Yao Wen today.
""We have already received some proposals on the Teesta river development. The
cost of those projects is very high. We want to implement the projects in phases,""
he said during a question-answer session at a seminar.
The seminar titled ""National Image of China in Bangladesh"" held at Sheraton,
Dhaka was organised by the Centre for Alternatives (CA) in collaboration with the
Chinese embassy in Dhaka today.
In 2020, the Ministry of Water Resources sought a $983 million loan from China to
implement the project which involves dredging the river for navigability, building
strong embankments, townships, industries on the two sides of the river, water
reservoir and irrigation.
Early March this year, the Chinese embassy sent a letter to the Economic
Relations Division suggesting that the project can be implemented in phases,
focusing first on solving the flood prevention and mitigation needs of the
Bangladeshi side.
At the seminar, Yao Wen said the relations between China and Bangladesh will
improve further after the January 7 elections.
He said China wants the people of Bangladesh to know more about Chinese role
in the development of Bangladesh as well as in South Asia. Chinese investment in
Bangladesh is going up and the quality projects under the Belt and Road Initiative
will take the relations to higher levels.
Prof Sk Tawfique M Haque, chair at the Department of Political Science and
Sociology of North South University, said the China should clarify that its way of
resolving the Rohingya crisis differs from that of other Western nations.
""Secondly, China should create a counter-narrative against the debt trap
narrative, as Bangladeshis are still suspicious of this narrative,"" he said at the
event.
Prof Shahab Enam Khan of International Relations at Jahangirnagar University
pointed out that 'acts of balancing' best describe relations between Bangladesh
and China.
Considering the country's trade with the foreign countries and national economic
priorities, he said Bangladesh must ensure a balanced relationship with China
and other development partners.

China's assistance for Chittagong port
development, not a military conspiracy
Tue Jun 26, 2018 12:00 AM
Last update on: Tue Jun 26, 2018 03:20 PM
Along with deepening the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
China has also accelerated its cooperation with the rest of the world in recent
years. However, some international media have increasingly reported China-led
BRI as an ambition of military expansion. These reports purposely define the
projects between China and countries along the Indian Ocean, particularly the
Gwardar port project in Pakistan, Hambantota port project in Sri Lanka and
Chittagong sea port. Photo: AFP
Chittagong port project in Bangladesh, as a part of China's ""string of pearl""
strategy in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). These reports also allege China's port
construction in the above-mentioned areas as an ambitious military plan.
The international media also says that China intends to control the maritime
energy channels in the Indian Ocean and expand the scope of its power through
developing ports in South Asian countries. As for example, China's willingness to
fund the development of Chittagong port is perceived by those media as a pearl of
the ""pearl string"" and as a part of the implementation of its strategy in the Indian
Ocean.
BBC, for instance, has published an article referring to whether Chittagong port
would become an important link of China's ""String of Pearls"" in the Indian Ocean.
The report claims that China's large-scale aid for Chittagong port development
represents Beijing's attempt to realise some special purposes.
This judgment appears absurd to China. The country's participation in Chittagong
port development is based on equal terms between China and Bangladesh. The
two sides have also signed a reciprocal agreement for the sake of achieving joint
economic and trade development. All details of the construction project have
been made open to the outside world and can definitely withstand any inspection.
Therefore, there is no military purpose behind China's funding of this project.
Meanwhile, it should be noted that the Chinese government has never issued any
strategy on the Indian Ocean in any occasion, let alone the ""String of Pearls"".
The bilateral cooperation on Chittagong port construction is a win-win choice for
both China and Bangladesh. In fact, it is apt to say that Bangladesh can benefit
more from the construction of the port than China. Chittagong port is the largest
and most important seaport in Bangladesh. However, it faces huge pressure to
handle cargo given the country's rising trade volume. The country's maritime
experts have been urging the government to modernise the port's infrastructure.
In addition, there is a strong demand from business communities in Bangladesh
to develop a deep-sea port as the capacity of Chittagong port reaches its limit. In
recent years, many countries in South Asia have upgraded their ports and even
developed state-of-the-art deep-sea ports. It is in this perspective that Beijing's
involvement in the port development has enabled Bangladesh to obtain access to
China's funding, technological and talent support.
The successful implementation of the project can not only improve the capacity
of the port bringing down cargo transportation cost by a large margin, but also
significantly upgrade Chittagong port's position in the international shipping
channels, turning it into a major port in the Indian Ocean. In this milieu,
Chittagong port can make full use of its complementary advantages of Kolkata
port in India and multiple ports in Southern Myanmar.
Most importantly, the development of Chittagong port project has also fuelled
bilateral ties between China and Bangladesh in other fields. Trade between the
two countries is booming. The single-point mooring and two 220km-long
pipelines connecting with Eastern Refinery Limited is scheduled to be completed
by China by 2020. The project is likely to greatly mitigate the dilemma of large-
tonnage ports in Bangladesh to have no inland terminal depots in Chittagong port
to stop at. Along with the port construction, the Karnaphuli river bottom tunnel
project, Padma Bridge Rail Link project, and Tongji-Bhairab Bazar Railway
Increased Construction Phase 2 project contracted by the Chinese enterprises are
all related to infrastructure development in Bangladesh. Benefiting from these
projects, the country can remarkably develop its sea ports and infrastructure,
thereby, strengthening its interconnectivity with surrounding countries.
To China, the project is mainly out of the concern for win-win economic
development. On the one hand, Chittagong port can facilitate trade activities
among countries along the Indian Ocean and beyond. As a responsible major
country in the world, China actively participates in overseas port construction.
These efforts can guarantee efficient operation of maritime transportation lines
of countries along the Indian Ocean and provide countries throughout the world
with more convenient logistics support. On the other hand, this project can
propel economic dynamism in the IOR.
To be noted, the IOR has been recognised as one of the major energy channels in
the world. China's participation in Chittagong port development can not only help
maintain China's energy channel safety, but also bring more transportation
conveniences for other countries in the world. Gradually, the Indian Ocean will
become even more economically dynamic and politically increasingly peaceful.
From the global perspective, China-Bangladesh port cooperation could not only
create mutual economic benefits, but also help other countries conduct trade and
commerce, taking advantage of convenient maritime infrastructure.
Ports are an important part of international transportation. Chittagong port
could play an even greater role, becoming an important bridge for South Asia to
reach Southeast Asia, East Asia and beyond. Therefore, further development of
Chittagong port will fasten Bangladesh's economic transition, making it into an
important emerging player in the Indian Ocean in this century.
To sum-up, China's financial assistance for Bangladesh's Chittagong port is a
pursuit of mutual benefits. It is an outcome of China-Bangladesh win-win
economic cooperation. In fact, trade, investment, cultural, academic and military
cooperation are all on the rise between the two countries banking on their
mutual interest. No military conspiracy is involved in any of the projects that
Dhaka and Beijing are embarking on.
For a long time, China has reaffirmed its position to the international community
against military expansion, armament race and alliance building. Last but not
least, China has long regarded countries along the Indian Ocean as partners
rather than players in a ""zero-sum game"". The Chinese culture deeply believes
that ""reconciliation benefits both whereas discord hurts both."" China has neither
the capability nor the ambition to build the so-called ""Pearl String"" to besiege any
country. Hence, the ""China Dream"" of the Chinese nation is consistent with
Bangladesh's dream of a ""Golden Bangladesh"" as well. China's BRI can, thereby,
bring more opportunities for a thriving Bangladesh. More significantly, China is
committed to contribute to a peaceful and prosperous Indian Ocean Region with
its wisdom.

Demystifying the Bangladesh-India-US
triangle
Wed Oct 2, 2024 09:00 AM
Last update on: Wed Oct 2, 2024 11:38 AM
On the evening of September 23, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi lifted off
from New York after several days of engagements, including a QUAD summit and
a meeting with US President Joe Biden. Several hours later, Dr Muhammad Yunus
touched down in New York for four action-packed days that included meetings
with Biden, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and many other top world
leaders—but not the previously departed Modi.
VISUAL: BIPLOB CHAKROBORTY
There was something telling about the visits of these two men: the top leaders of
Bangladesh and India were each seemingly working at cross purposes, with each
going about his business in the US separately and without engaging the other. It's
a sobering reflection of the state of Bangladesh-India relations today, following
15-plus years of foolproof, fulsome ties during the Sheikh Hasina era.

India, US both need a stable Bangladesh
Each leader's visit to the US was also indicative of the present state of the
Bangladesh-India-US triangle. It can best be described as an isosceles structure,
with two long and sturdy sides represented by robust Bangladesh-US and India-
US ties, and a short and fragile side marked by shaky Bangladesh-India relations.
Let's first take the Bangladesh-US relations. They're in a good place. Yunus is a
man whom Washington likes, knows well, and is comfortable working with. A
senior US delegation to Dhaka last month telegraphed a crystal clear message:
we're here to help on the development, humanitarian and reforms front. It's a
genuine pledge, and it was amplified at the highest level—by Biden himself—days
later.
The India-US ties are also strong. Tension points do abound, from the Khalistan
issue to each country's friendly ties with the other's main rival. But strong
strategic convergences over countering China limit their impact on the
relationship. An increasingly multifaceted partnership—manifested by
proliferating areas of cooperation on separate non-geopolitical tracks, from trade
and clean energy to higher education and science and technology—provides
further insulation against shocks to bilateral ties.

India needs to pursue equal partnership with Bangladesh
But then there's the troubled side of the triangle. Because New Delhi invested so
heavily, and for so long, in Hasina and her party, it has limited links to those now
in power and lacks the leverage to ensure its interests are properly addressed.
Incidentally, this isn't just a BJP problem—the Congress party also enjoyed strong
ties with Hasina, which go back to her father 's close friendship with Indira
Gandhi.
Additionally, while Indian media have wildly exaggerated security risks in post-
Hasina Bangladesh, there have been threats to and attacks on Bangladeshi
Hindus, prompting them to stage protests demanding more security. Also,
hardline religious elements that are no friends of New Delhi have gained more
space and influence. And from India's perspective, this isn't just about the return
of Jamaat-e-Islami. Jashimuddin Rahmani, head of the banned al Qaeda-inspired
militant group Ansar al Islam, was quietly released from jail on August 26. It may
have been a matter of due process. But mere days after his release, Rahmani
released a disturbing video in which he issued threats against India—including
calling on India's enemies to break the country into pieces—if India ""cast[s] an
evil eye towards Bangladesh."" This is deeply concerning for New Delhi.

US delegation visit: A new chapter in Bangladesh-US
relations?
India's fears about the present are informed by memories of the past: there are
documented cases of abuses against Hindus during the BNP-led period of rule
between 2001 and 2006. Additionally, during that same period, authorities
intercepted a massive arms shipment in Chattogram, bound for rebels in India's
restive northeast. According to new scholarship that validates long-standing
Indian suspicions, the arms transfer involved several BNP and Jamaat officials
and a Bangladesh-based Indian rebel leader.
This helps explain why India is so uncomfortable about Bangladesh's radically
changed new political reality, and why it will tread carefully in its relations with
Dhaka. The unbanning of Jamaat is especially concerning for New Delhi, and will
become more so if the group forms new alliances with other Islamist parties. All
this has prompted New Delhi to double down on its long-standing Bangladeshi
allies, especially Hasina. India is unlikely to turn her over to Dhaka if there's a
formal extradition request. The Hasina factor could deepen bilateral tensions,
complicating efforts to address challenges that loomed large even in better times,
from border security to the Teesta River issue. It also risks fresh surges in anti-
India sentiment in Bangladesh, which hurts bilateral ties as well.
All this said, geopolitics is never cut and dry. Let's clear up some misconceptions
about the Bangladesh-India-US triangle.

The geopolitics of Sheikh Hasina's fall explained
The Bangladesh-US ties have experienced a reset. Yunus's arrival is a breath of
fresh air for a relationship that became increasingly toxic due to US tensions with
Hasina over rights and democracy. But the true reset arguably happened back in
February, soon after Bangladesh's election (which Washington characterised as
not free or fair), when President Biden penned a letter to Hasina welcoming the
""next chapter"" in bilateral ties—with no reference to rights or democracy.
Washington would subsequently identify as priorities a range of issues, including
several being emphasised now, such as reforms. The administration apparently
concluded it was time to give renewed attention to subjects—strategic
cooperation, trade, defence—that had previously helped boost relations, before
being eclipsed by tensions over rights and democracy. Yunus's arrival will help
consolidate that earlier reset.
However, these changes could prove short-lived. Another Donald Trump
presidency could prompt relations to lose momentum. Key issues now driving
partnership—development and humanitarian assistance, climate change—likely
wouldn't appeal to him. He probably wouldn't take kindly to Yunus's past criticism
of him either. Trump may take a different approach, preferring instead to view
the relationship solely through the lens of great power competition, along with
trade.

Reviving SAARC can help South Asia overcome its current
crisis
The Bangladesh-India relations are not doomed yet. Though New Delhi will be
cautious, it's committed to continued engagement. External Affairs Minister S
Jaishankar recently met Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain in
New York, and Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka Pranay Verma met BNP
Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir. A formal BNP-Jamaat split,
perhaps already underway, could provide openings for New Delhi to cultivate a
new relationship with BNP. Additionally, India will likely reach out to
Bangladesh's army that, because of the recent vacuum, has increased its political
influence. Ultimately, India may conclude that given its economic and security
interests in Bangladesh, it simply can't afford to lose Dhaka. Conducting delicate
negotiations over border security, for example, is easier with a workable
relationship with Dhaka.
Washington and New Delhi don't see eye to eye on Bangladesh. Their approaches
to the new government are quite different. But they still have shared interests and
concerns. Neither wants Dhaka to inch closer to Beijing—though the new
government will likely be prepared to move closer to Beijing than did the
previous one, because it won't be as concerned about how New Delhi might
respond. Additionally, neither wants more space for hardline Islamists which,
ideologically speaking, oppose them both. The Rahmani case—even if an
unsettling outlier—will worry New Delhi and Washington alike.
Ideally, the Bangladesh-India-US triangle would be equilateral instead of
isosceles. But for now, the best bet is to manage its volatilities and imbalances
and better understand its intricacies, thereby helping it achieve some stability in
a world increasingly on fire.

ʻBangladesh can’t wait forever to resolve
the Teesta issue’
Mon Sep 5, 2022 07:41 PM
Last update on: Tue Sep 6, 2022 04:17 PM
Dr Im tiaz Ahmed, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, talks
about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ongoing visit to India and what to expect in
the future of Bangladesh-India relations in an interview with Shuprova
Tasneem of The Daily Star.
Will importing fuel from Russia be a major talking point during the prime
minister's trip, and can that affect our relationship with other nations?িতা  িনেয়  খালাখুিল  আেলাচনা  হওয়া  উিচত িতা  িনেয়  খালাখুিল  আেলাচনা  হওয়া  উিচত
In light of the Covid pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, there will definitely
be a focus on energy security. India still has a relationship with Russia and has
not looked into sanctions the way the West wanted. Bangladesh would definitely
want to learn how we can benefit from this relationship.
At the same time, one should know that any energy insecurity in Bangladesh
would also become a problem for the West. Our main export markets for ready-
made garment (RMG) products are in the US and Europe. If we suffer from energy
insecurity and it costs us more to produce RMG products, it will also increase
their costs and reduce their profit margins. So I believe it will be a win-win
situation for all if we can resolve our energy problems, either through a good
relationship with Russia by purchasing directly, or through help from India,
particularly when it comes to payment and other mechanisms.
How important is Bangladesh in India's Look East Policy, especially given
India's current relationship with China?
The importance depends on how much honey there is in the pot. If there is more
instability and less economic development, this interest will fizzle out. Ultimately,
geopolitics does not create human beings – it's human beings who create
geopolitics. Bangladesh's growth momentum over the last 15-20 years, despite the
obstacles faced, is what makes other countries interested in us, including India.
Bangladesh has by now managed to convince the world that what we are
interested in is economic development. It comes from our long-cherished goal of
becoming a peaceful country – a goal that was set by the father of the nation. So
whether we have ties with India, China, Japan, the US or Russia – all of it is based
on an economic relationship, not security or military development. At the same
time, Bangladesh guarantees that we would not allow anyone to use our territory
against anyone else. That's what leads to favourable ties with Dhaka regardless of
who is in power in India, because the current regime has made good on this
promise, especially in terms of dealing with insurgency coming from the
northeast. So I don't think Delhi or Beijing have any worries over Bangladesh's ties
with others, since a military alliance is never on the cards.

PM Hasina’s India visit: Will our expectations be met?
There are some concerns that Bangladesh is too dependent on trade with India
when it comes to essential goods. What is your view on this?
No country would want to be dependent on one source. We've had hiccups in this
regard, especially in terms of onion import, which forced us to look to Egypt and
Pakistan. We have already opened a channel with Russia for wheat, so I don't
think this is really an issue. The problem is that whenever we discuss trade or
connectivity, we fall back on traditional linkages and use a piecemeal approach.
Political will is required to look at the bigger picture. To this date, we have not
been able to mainstream technology and talk about creating new structures. For
example, we are currently discussing updating railway structures from the British
era. But with the existing technology, it's not difficult to think of a high-speed
train between Dhaka and Delhi. There are countries that have changed their
entire geographical composition like this, such as China. So why are we not
thinking about this?
The first thing that needs to change is our mindset. We are very conservative
when it comes to planning and investing in long-term projects. The fact that India
spends huge resources on the conflict with Pakistan could be part of this. There
are an estimated half a million troops in Kashmir alone, it's unthinkable. But
beyond the funding, there is also a lack of imagination. Technology has given us
the opportunity to not be slaves to geography, and we should take advantage of
that. The possibilities in this region are immense.
While there are talks of other water-sharing treaties, we are still no closer to a
resolution on the Teesta.
I can't speak for the policymakers, but it's possible they think that if we go
forward with other water-sharing agreements, we can tone down the issue of
Teesta and return to it later. But if we fail to resolve the Teesta issue and go ahead
with other agreements, then there will of course be criticism, and the
government will have to deal with that. One estimate suggests that the livelihoods
of 20 million people are impacted by the Teesta River. If we keep their concerns
hanging for so long, despite there even being a draft agreement, and move on to
other rivers that don't impact as many people, it will definitely become a political
and a partisan issue.
So why is the Teesta issue not being resolved? We need to have frank discussions
with Delhi on the factor that is Sikkim. There are 30-32 small and big dams for
hydroelectric power that are estimated to be affecting around five percent of
water flow in each of the dams, according to one eminent Indian hydrologist,
leading to a lean seasonal flow draining into Bangladesh. Mamata Banerjee's
contention around Teesta is all about this – not considering Sikkim in the
calculations.
Will they deconstruct the dams? Of course not. But Bangladesh can try to solve
this by storing rain/floodwater from the rainy season and letting it flow during
winter. There are environmental and monetary costs: one calculation suggests it
will be around USD 1 billion. Although China showed some interest, India
immediately became fearful of it. One way to resolve this is by creating a
consortium where different stakeholders can provide the funding and expertise
for this infrastructure. India must accept that Bangladesh will not wait forever to
resolve this issue.

Understanding the proposed Bangladesh-India
Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)
Will Myanmar an d the Rohingya refugees be a part of the discussions in Delhi?
Definitely. The point that some of us are also raising is, now that there are talks
about a tripartite engagement on the Rohingyas between China, Myanmar and
Bangladesh, why can't Delhi organise the same? That is something I think our
prime minister would flag this time, especially since we have not seen much
progress on this issue. Given that India has good relationships with both
Bangladesh and Myanmar, it can play a critical role. Take, for example, Turkey's
involvement in talks between Russia and Ukraine to open a Black Sea corridor for
the export of grains, which helped it become one of the big players when it comes
to negotiations in this conflict. Playing a similar role in the Rohingya issue could
also boost India's global status. This is especially pertinent now after the two ICJ
judgments recognising the ""Rohingya"" identity and the US calling the Myanmar
military actions against the Rohingyas a ""genocide.""
Why have we stopped talking about border killings?
This is very unfortunate. If a smuggler is not armed, you can arrest him, but
killing him is not permitted under the Indian Constitution or the international
law. And then there are the killings of civilians like 15-year-old Felani Khatun.
Yet, during the Galwan dispute on the India-China border, not a single shot was
fired. Why is that? Because of a 1996 agreement between China and India that
stipulates no-one can carry firearms for two kilometres on each side of the
border. So if this can be done there, why can't it be done on our borders?

China yet to turn into big export
destination
Thu Jul 4, 2024 12:00 AM
Last update on: Thu Jul 4, 2024 12:47 PM
The country offered generous trade benefits to Bangladesh
China could not become a potential export destination for Bangladesh despite
offering generous preferential trade benefits for the past decade or so.
On the other hand, two Asian countries, India and Japan, have proved to be very
good export destinations for Bangladesh over the years.
Bangladesh's exports to Japan reached $1.69 billion in the July-May period of the
immediate past fiscal year and stood at $1.90 billion in fiscal year 2022-23,
according to data from the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).
The export of local merchandise to India reached $1.67 billion in the July-May
period of the immediate past fiscal year and $2.12 billion in fiscal year 2022-23.
The shipment of goods from Bangladesh to China reached $761.02 million in the
July-May period of the immediate past fiscal year and $677.35 million in fiscal
year 2022-23.
The exports to China did not grow that much in spite of the presence of a zero-
duty benefit for 98 percent of Bangladeshi products.
But China has eventually turned into the largest import destination for
Bangladesh, with annual imports reaching over $23 billion, according to data
from the commerce ministry.
In 2015, China offered various least developed countries (LDCs) extensions on the
trade benefits for up to 97 percent of their goods and later the percentage was
elevated to up to 98 percent for Bangladesh.
The share of China in Bangladesh's imports has risen from 10.3 percent in FY02 to
26.4 percent in FY22, according to a study by Mohammad Abdur Razzaque,
chairman of the Research and Policy Integration for Development (RAPID), made
public last month.
Imports from China rose from less than $1 billion to more than $23.5 billion in
FY23. Imports from China are important for Bangladesh's export growth and
domestic industries as well for consumers.
A significant portion of imports from China come through bonded warehouses
duty free as those are used in the export industry.
One of the main reasons for exports not increasing to China is a lack of product
diversification.
Because China itself is the largest apparel and textile supplier worldwide
occupying more nearly 32 percent of the global share.
China imports $10 billion worth of garment items in a year from all over the
world while Bangladesh's main export item is garments which typically
contributes more than 84 percent to national exports in a year, according to the
paper.
China and Bangladesh are holding dialogues for signing a free trade agreement
(FTA) to increase trade and investment, with the first round of negotiations likely
to begin during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to China next week.
Bangladesh currently accounts for just 0.04 percent of China's imports. A share of
1 percent would translate to export earnings of $26 billion for Bangladesh,
Razzaque said in his study.
In case of garments, Bangladesh's market share in China is just 4 percent. In
contrast, Vietnam has an 18 percent share, the study also said.
The study also found that China's investment in Bangladesh's export-oriented
sectors would be very helpful.
Due to the heightening of geopolitical tensions, Bangladesh could be an ideal
destination for investment in export-oriented manufacturing production, it said.
An FTA with China will be extremely beneficial, considering the medium to long-
term export interests of Bangladesh. In such an FTA, due attention should be
given to trade in services and technology transfer, it added.
However, Bangladesh needs to improve on its exports to China. An FTA with
China with provisions for complementary investment inflows into Bangladesh's
export sector will be very much impactful, said the study.
Meanwhile, China should extend its duty-free market access benefits for
Bangladesh. In an FTA, the less-than-full reciprocity principle should be followed
in favour of Bangladesh, it said.
Once the FTA is signed, the use of the duty-free benefit can be thoroughly
utilised, Al Mamun Mridha, secretary general of the Bangladesh China Chamber
of Commerce and Industry, told The Daily Star yesterday.
The trade gap between Bangladesh and China is big because the local exporters,
especially the garment exporters, import the raw materials from China to re-
export to other countries, Mridha also said.

The interim government must talk about jobs, industrialisation and the partnership with
China
VISUAL: ANWAR SOHEL
If Bangladesh is suspended within the geopolitical tripod of India, China and the
United States, where are we positioning now? The current discourse suggests that
priorities are set where the near-neighbour with the largest GDP on the planet
only gets bronze, not silver, and certainly not gold.
Beijing keeps its customary quiet demeanour, scrupulously keeping to its
decades-long policy of not publicly interfering in internal matters. They are,
however, quite interested in the events of the Bengal delta. The Global Times on
August 12 noted that Donald Lu's visit in May was seen by some as ""part of a
strategy to pressure Hasina into acting against China."" Liu Zongzi, director of the
Center of South Asia Studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies,
guessed that the reason for the US ""seeking to overthrow her [Hasina]"" was ""(her
non-compliance) with the US on many issues.""
Myanmar an d St Martin's Island
Let's chat about St Martin's Island, a tiny, three square-kilometre coral outpost, as

It took mere minutes to walk from one end to the other. Could this fragile place
really be the location for a US base, to add to their 800-plus others around the
globe? Eight kilometres off the coast of Arakan, some suggest it could be a
listening post and a forward deployment point. In the age of drones, could one
intervene in Arakan and the rest of Myanmar? It reminds us how Bangladesh and
Myanmar security forces faced off each other in 2018.

Mission to China: Is the PM ready to take a bold position
on RCEP?
Whether it is St Martin's or Teknaf is not the issue. Beijing is naturally alarmed by
the civil war in Myanmar, with which it shares a long porous border. Instability in
this resource-rich place directly affects Yunnan. Given that the US is confronting
China in the Taiwan Straits, it is plausible that a ""second front"" might appear on
the Irrawaddy (Ayeyarwady). If Dhaka shifts from Delhi to Washington's orbit with
this new administration (or possibly a BNP one), Beijing will naturally look at the
security implications across the Naf River and beyond.
In 2024, the unipolar world of yesteryear has disappeared.
China is the manufacturing core of the world. It is the largest
consumer market, too. It is just that we have little to sell to
them, hence the urgent necessity to set up newer production
lines to create higher skilled jobs.
More than a million Rohingya remain trapped in an open air confinement in
Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar. Imploring China to assist with their repatriation begs
the question: why are they going to spend enormous amounts of political capital
in dealing with the brutal Tatmadaw or the Arakan Army? Dhaka needs to
formulate a much broader policy on Myanmar, which takes into consideration
Beijing's anxieties and seeks common ground between the two. That would be a
first. Besides the Rohingya, how often have our political elites ever evinced an
interest in Myanmar—and thus China?
There was one time. In 2012, there were talks of Chinese willingness to build a
direct road from Kunming via Mandalay to Teknaf, which was shelved. India
leaned on Yangon to block that lifeline. Later, Delhi also put an end to the longer
route from Kunming to Kolkata, via Dhaka, which had been rebranded as BCIM
(Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor).

Treating China like a cash cow?
This is where we come to the nub of the problem. We see China as just a giant
foreign aid ATM. They are ready to lend and build as part of the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), but they also seek a deeper partnership.
Even though I had my fears, I wrote a piece in this daily in July, titled ""Mission to
China."" I was shocked how disastrous the trip to Beijing turned out to be. Last
year, in discussions in Dhaka, I was led to believe that the Awami League
government would shift dramatically to Beijing after securing its victory in the
January 7 (s)election. But would Delhi allow such a thing? This year, Sheikh
Hasina made not one, but two, visits to Delhi. The second one looked like a
dressing down by the South Block. Chinese offers to invest over a billion dollars
in saving the little water that came from the Teesta River were to be rejected. So
were any major breakthroughs. So, the former foreign minister, Hasan Mahmud,
and associates bandied about the sum of money they would ask out of China. $5
billion worth of yuan, which became $2 billion. More infrastructure—easy to
syphon commissions from, perhaps.
This was capped off by a severe breach of diplomatic protocol. Hasina and her
courtiers tore up the schedule and returned one night earlier. Mahmud claimed it
was because she was terribly ill. Even if it was because they got wind of the
seriousness of the student revolt, the then foreign minister and colleagues could
have remained. But no, they returned—all smiles. Criticisms were batted away
with a prime ministerial diagnosis that our heads had to be examined.
As a gift, China upgraded the relationship to that of a Comprehensive Strategic
Cooperative Partnership. Has anyone noticed much of any dialogue or
observations about this?
That was then, this is now
Over the last decade, we have been unable to work with China to build a new
industrial export sector to wean us away from our dangerous dependency on the
RMG sector. Jagaran Chakma's report in this daily last month detailed the painful
odyssey of the Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone. The 784-acre site in
Chattogram was allocated for Chinese industry. Intended to create as many as
200,000 jobs, it is still inoperative for eight long years.

Echoes of colonialism in Bangladesh
The interim government must talk about jobs, industrialisation and the
partnership with China. Last month, the issue, at its ultimate core, was not only
the unfair distribution of bureaucratic posts; it was also the profound lack of
decent employment in the private sector. To solve that, one needs a policy, a
strategy and shedloads of capital. Right now, only China offers that quantity of
capital and expertise to invest in new industries. Supply chains, component-
producing factories, industrial clusters are all exporting to earn dollars and yuan.
This should form the basis of the developmental discourse, and it should be
steered towards modern industry and associated technology.
In 2024, the unipolar world of yesteryear has disappeared. China is the
manufacturing core of the world. It is the largest consumer market, too. It is just
that we have little to sell to them, hence the urgent necessity to set up newer
production lines to create higher skilled jobs.
Can Md Touhid Hossain convince us that Bangladesh has not moved merely from
the Indian leg of the tripod directly to a distant Western power? I would like to
hear more about how Bangladesh will work with China, to genuinely further
mutual interests. This is still a least developed country. Tens of millions of young
Bangladeshis are rightly impatient. Time is short.

Ahead of the second BRI Summit in Beijing, prime minister’s international affairs adviser
Gowher Rizvi on Saturday said Bangladesh welcomed China’s Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) as it fits Bangladesh’s national priorities.
“Bangladesh is proud to be part of this initiative,” he said while addressing the launching
ceremony of the first magazine in Bangladesh, “The Belt and Road” exclusively covering
the highlights of the vision of “The Belt and Road Initiative” held at the auditorium of
Institute of Modern Languages at Dhaka University.

Delwar Hossain addressed the launching programe chaired and moderated by former
ambassador Selina Mohsin.
In fact, Gowher said, long before the BRI was announced they had their own BCIM
(Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar) Economic Corridor which is essentially a
reduced version of the Belt and Road Initiative.
He said the creation of BRI along with other initiatives is an important opportunity for
development of the region. “Bangladesh is extremely successful in managing its foreign
relations,” he added.
Prof Li Tao, executive director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at Sichuan
University in China, recently told UNB that Bangladesh holds an important ‘geopolitical
strategic position’ in the BRI that offers ‘great potential’ to strengthen economic and
trade cooperation between Bangladesh and China.
“We should strengthen cooperation between the two governments, and at the same time
focus on strengthening inter-party exchanges,” she said.
The BRI is a multi-billion-dollar initiative launched by Chinese president Xi Jinping. This
mega initiative emerged when president Xi came to power in 2013.
During Xi’s historic visit to Dhaka in 2016, Bangladesh formally joined the ‘Belt and Road
Initiative’, a drive which has already drawn the close attention of the world.
The Centre for East Asia Foundation (CEAF), a non-profit and non-political independent
study circle launched the magazine.
Along with the publication, a website dedicated to “The Belt and Road Initiative’ – bri-
ceafbd.com - was also launched. The publication will have Bengali and English sections
for wider audience.
Executive director of the foundation Nasim Mahmmud said the traditional friendship
between China and Bangladesh by land across the Himalayas and along the silk routes
date back to over 2000 years.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/252666/why-bangladesh-has-been-ignoring-india’s-warnings 1/11Many in South Asia view major foreign powers (like China) and changes in status quo (like new
economic relationships) with caution.
A history of colonialism and non-alignment are shared experiences across the region. These
experiences contribute to a principled worldview, which does not readily accept terms defined by
realpolitik, and prefers to redefine issues based on precedent.
However, smaller countries in the region – like Bangladesh – have shown greater willingness to
adapt to new trade and investment flows. India, meanwhile, has become more cautious.
These differing viewpoints are reflected in reporting on Chinese economic activity in South Asia.
Also Read: How Indian media reporting on Bangladesh is distorted by bad faith
Journalists in Bangladesh concerned themselves with the practicalities of China’s economic
activity. Their work focused on events. They illustrated their stories with context.
Counterparts in India, and further abroad, expressed broader concerns about China’s economic
activity. Their work focused on relationships. They illustrated their stories with perspectives.
This reflects a larger schism between fact- and opinion-based reporting.
It represents a distinct challenge for foreign news reporting and analysis, which often depends on
third-hand accounts, collected in the days after spot reporting, or later when any debate has boiled
over.

Invariably, journalists who would like to present “both sides” of China’s economic activity in
event-based stories, and commentators who would like to express their distrust of China’s
intentions in opinionated stories, refer to debt trap diplomacy, or utilize its narrative logic.
The debt trap diplomacy theory was created in 2017 by Brahma Chellaney, a strategist at the
Centre for Policy Research. He created the theory to describe risks he associated with China’s
Belt and Road Initiative or BRI, a global development programme unveiled as “One Belt, One
Road” in 2013.

Chellaney alleged that Beijing used the BRI to further China’s geopolitical interests.
Debt trap diplomacy lulled countries into unsustainable loans for infrastructure projects. This
produced assets that Beijing could use for political leverage, and seize if borrowers could not
afford repayment.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/252666/why-bangladesh-has-been-ignoring-india’s-warnings 3/11The debt trap concept provided a theoretical framework for critics of the BRI. It also seemed to
explain motive in several high-profile deals involving Chinese state-owned enterprises – namely
a 2011 land lease in Tajikistan and the 2017 Hambantota Port lease and equity sale in Sri Lanka.
The trouble for debt trap proponents is that China didn’t appear to cancel debt as part of the deals.
Borrowers still owned their debt, and assets.

Tajikistan’s land lease was designed to commercialize agricultural development. Sri Lanka used
the income from the port lease and equity investment for repayments unrelated to the port, or
China.
More recently, the term has been used to describe Laos’ 2020 power grid lease and equity sale to
a Chinese state-owned enterprise. But reporting hasn’t shown that China cancelled debt as part of
the deal. Some analysts expect Laos to use the income for revenue-generating power exports.
These cases don’t serve as textbook asset seizures – the supposed goal of debt traps.
Scant evidence
The How China Lends: A Rare Look into 100 Debt Contracts with Foreign Governments study –
co-published by AidData, the Centre for Global Development, the Kiel Institute for the World
Economy, and the Peterson Institute for International Economics – found scant evidence of debt
traps.
Specifically, the study’s authors found “little evidence […] that China’s state-owned banks
routinely use physical infrastructure – like a seaport or a power plant – as collateral” in their
review of 100 contracts between Chinese lenders and government borrowers in 24 countries
across the world.
However, the study did find contracts contained aggressive clauses. These clauses had more in
common with commercial lending terms than terms offered by bilateral or multilateral lenders.
The authors noted that, while all creditors seek influence for repayment, commercial terms take
on new meaning when used in government-to-government lending. Especially if Chinese lenders
were to leverage their contracts over a borrower during a debt crisis.

These findings show that states who borrow more than they can afford may find themselves in a
tight spot with China. Still, research to date hasn’t uncovered enough case examples.
Instead, research to date has shown that BRI outcomes are largely defined by borrowing
governments, and their ability to manage projects, lenders, and contractors.
Like How China Lends authors, the Rhodium Group, an economic research firm, didn’t find any
clear-cut asset seizures in a review of 130 bilateral debt renegotiations involving China between
2000 and 2020.
The firm’s previous research found bilateral debt renegotiations with China “usually involve a
more balanced outcome between lender and borrower, ranging from extensions of loan terms and
repayment deadlines to explicit refinancing, or partial or even total debt forgiveness”.
Further, they found renegotiations often favoured the borrower, rather than China, particularly
when borrowers had alternative sources of funding, or experienced a change in political
leadership.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/252666/why-bangladesh-has-been-ignoring-india’s-warnings 5/11Taken together, the research suggests that China’s contracts may reflect its insecurities, rather
than “creditor imperialism” designed to support “neo-colonial designs,” as Chellaney alleged.
The country is, after all, a new overseas lender financing ambitious state-owned enterprises in
high-risk locations.
Bumps in the road
And the BRI is far from a runaway success.
Many projects have failed to materialize, while lenders have written-off others. State-owned
enterprises have clammed up when they realised a project was poorly designed, or cost too much.
Lenders, meanwhile, have little interest in playing rough – that would only create political
problems for Beijing.
As Shahar Hameiri, associate professor at the University of Queensland, has written, a twist on
Hanlon’s razor applies: “Never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence.”
But debt trap diplomacy allegations have persisted in spite of literature that has questioned its
merit, from the BRI’s origins in China, to its application across the world. And the burden of
proof has remained in the hands of its critics, rather than its claimants, on a country-by-country
basis.
That means countries like Bangladesh are just one soft report away from their next debt trap
drama.

Asian News International made the most specific debt trap allegation against Bangladesh in 2019.
The news agency has been accused of publishing disinformation and propaganda, including on
Bangladesh. But the article was syndicated by credible broadsheets and its allegations were later
refined by commentators.
According to the ANI article, Bangladesh’s Payra port project could “fall into Chinese hands.”
The article was allegedly based on comments made by “officials in Dhaka.” The article suggested
the officials said, “It will not be a long time before China starts asserting more control over the
Payra port.”
The article further claimed the officials believed China’s investments were “a smokescreen to
obfuscate their real intentions, which was [sic] to establish sovereign control over a crucial
Bangladeshi port.”
The article correctly noted that two Chinese state-owned enterprises signed memoranda of
understanding for project components. But it didn’t mention other firms were bidding on other

to work on the project.
Dhaka had employed a model it often used for its infrastructure projects.
It divided port development “into 19 components, opting for separate funding strategies for each
component that ranges from government-to-government cooperation to public private
partnership,” according to Abdullah Ar Rafee, a researcher at the Institute for Policy, Advocacy,
and Governance.
Bangladesh is financing dredging work. India is financing a terminal. Dhaka wants China and
Japan to finance other components. Others may step up if tapped.
Well-placed sources in Dhaka would have been aware of these details. The fact that ANI’s
sources were not aware suggests they weren’t well-placed to comment.
Unbridled speculation
Either way, the Payra port allegation illustrates where debt trap proponents so often go wrong.
Few examine how projects are designed, financed, or awarded before making an allegation. This
is why projects involving China in any way are often mentioned as part of debt trap speculation.
The debt trap theory – one scholar called it a “meme” – has become a catch-all.
Proponents use the term to warn of a variety of risks they associate with infrastructure projects
financed, or constructed, by China. Sometimes regardless of whether financing is unsustainable.
The way some commentators now describe debt traps could be misunderstood as ensnaring whole
countries. They refer to a general vulnerability to a debt trap-like situation. They use information
that implies Beijing compromises borrowers’ government or market to support their view.
This lay usage creates grounds for near-constant debt trap speculation in countries like
Bangladesh. The sheer improbability of such allegations rarely attracts critical analysis. But it’s
not beyond rebuttal.
Gowher Rizvi, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister of Bangladesh, told The Indian
Express, “our relationship with China is very much confined to investments and development
projects. However, even then we have been very mindful. We do not want to create a situation
where we have borrowed more than we can repay. We have learnt from Sri Lanka; we have learnt
from Djibouti.”
x25/05/2025, 14:49 Why Bangladesh has been ignoring India’s warnings about the Chinese ‘debt trap’
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/252666/why-bangladesh-has-been-ignoring-india’s-warnings 8/11Bangladesh is not a sitting duck. Multilateral creditors hold most of Bangladesh’s debt – not
China.
Dr AK Abdul Momen, Bangladesh’s foreign minister, said, “Many critics argue that since
Bangladesh has undertaken a large number of mega projects through borrowing from other
countries, it may fall into debt trap, but it is not true.” He noted China held just 6.5% of the
country’s external debt.
These comments speak to a more serious problem. Many borrowers simply don’t believe in the
debt trap idea because it doesn’t reflect their experience. That’s because it presents borrowers as
powerless.
The World Bank and Asian Development Bank are Bangladesh’s biggest creditors. These funders,
among others, like Japan and the US, have been working in Bangladesh for decades. That
experience has increased bureaucrats’ ability to select financing that serve their interests.
This may be part of the reason Bangladesh has managed it external debt so responsibly.
The International Monetary Fund reported Bangladesh had a “low risk of overall and external
debt distress” before the Covid-19 slowdown and a “sustainable” debt profile afterwards.
In June 2020, Dhaka reported a 14.7% external debt-to-GDP ratio. Experts generally advise
developing economies not to breach a 40% threshold.
‘Low risk’
Several studies have confirmed that BRI financing was unlikely to cause Bangladesh debt
distress.
In 2019, the World Bank found that Bangladesh wasn’t likely to experience BRI-related debt
vulnerability. In 2018, the centre for Global Development described Bangladesh as having a “low
risk” of debt distress, with a “small” risk from further BRI financing.
The authors of both reports used generous estimates for projected BRI investments.
Their data was based on open-source research due to the absence of official BRI data. For
example, the World Bank estimated that Bangladesh was due US $32 billion in BRI investments.
This figure was based on projects that were either planned, implemented, or completed between
2013 and 2018.
It is then possible that Bangladesh’s BRI debt vulnerability may now be even lower than
assessed.
 x25/05/2025, 14:49 Why Bangladesh has been ignoring India’s warnings about the Chinese ‘debt trap’
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/252666/why-bangladesh-has-been-ignoring-india’s-warnings 9/11Much of what is publicly known about China’s investment in Bangladesh comes from MoU
announcements. That means researchers are dependent on figures announced for projects in the
planning phase – projects that haven’t been implemented or completed.
A majority of these MoUs were announced when China’s president Xi Jinping visited Dhaka in
2016.
The Daily Star, an English-language daily from Dhaka, recently reported that only seven of the
27 BRI MoUs announced in October 2016 have been implemented. China has disbursed $1.6
billion against the $5.4 billion planned for the seven projects.
These figures are well shy of the $24 billion initially projected.
Dhaka scrapped several projects. These include a highway and a coal plant. At least two rail
projects appear set for the chopping block. They never implemented others.
Most recently, Dhaka asked Beijing to swap five projects from 2016 worth $5.26 billion –
including the cancelled highway and coal projects – for five new projects worth $1.65 billion.
These developments suggest the countries are unlikely to achieve the $24 billion announced in
2016, or more bullish figures floated since then. But the countries will likely continue to work
together.
David Dollar, a senior fellow at Brookings, has explained that many developing countries – like
Bangladesh – prefer Chinese financing for infrastructure projects. That is because Western donors
primarily finance capacity building programs, and private loans are too expensive.
Countries “rationally allocate China to do transport and power, the Western donors to do social
sectors, and private bondholders to provide general, short-term budget finance,” according to
Dollar.
Dhaka will then likely continue to seek out financing from China because Beijing’s financial
interests are well suited to Bangladesh’s infrastructure needs.
But it won’t stop Dhaka from pursuing other opportunities.
In March, for example, Dhaka established the Bangladesh Infrastructure Development Fund. The
fund will use foreign exchange reserves to invest $2 billion a year in port and power projects.
When analysts view these factors together, they may come to see the BRI commitments made
between 2016 and 2020 as demonstrative. It announced the interest Beijing and Dhaka had in
collaboration. Some of the projects they forged worked out, many did not.

Statements of this kind from Bangladesh’s leader point to a new reality for the country, where
balancing two of Asia’s rising powers is slowly becoming the diplomatic mainstay. As the
strategic rivalry between India and China intensifies, Bangladesh increasingly finds itself
embroiled in a great game along the Indian Ocean region.
Bangladesh’s importance in the strategic calculations of India and China stems not only from its
pivotal geographical location on the Indian Ocean -- Bangladesh is one of the fastest-growing
economies in the region and the most populous Least Developed Country, and it recently became
eligible to graduate to developing country status by 2024.
Development -- both physical (large-scale infrastructure and military capabilities) and social
(human resources and services) -- is likely to remain a central national priority for Bangladesh in
the coming decades. Therefore, Bangladesh is keen to leverage exposure from the great China-
India connectivity rivalry.  
China’s foray into South Asia -- generally considered to be India’s diplomatic backyard -- is
relatively new. Apart from long-lasting ties with Pakistan, China’s economic engagement with
South Asian countries only began in the last two decades. In this short period of time, China has
emerged as a top trade partner in the region.
In 2005 China overtook India as Bangladesh’s principal source of imports, most notably in
defense trade (SIPRI Yearbook 2017). Bangladesh is now the second-largest importer of Chinese
arms in the world after Pakistan.
x25/05/2025, 15:02 Between big brothers China and India
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/148511/between-big-brothers-china-and-india 2/5During Chinese President Xi’s visit to Bangladesh in 2016, his country offered a gargantuan
$24.45 billion to Dhaka in bilateral assistance for infrastructure projects. This amount, along with
an earlier $13.6bn investment in joint ventures, brings Chinese investment in Bangladesh to a
total of $38bn, the largest sum ever pledged to Bangladesh by a single country.
But, out of the three promised Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) mega-projects in Bangladesh, only
one -- the $1.65bn Payra coal power plant -- is under construction. The Dhaka-Jessore rail line is
still in the planning phase while the Karnaphuli underwater tunnel has just started.
Despite slow disbursements, these overtures were lucrative enough to encourage Bangladesh to
formally voice support for Xi’s flagship BRI. More recently, China purchased a 25% stake in the
Dhaka Stock Exchange, outbidding the Indian offer and expanding the sphere of power rivalry
from hard infrastructure to financial assets.
All this is bad news for India, which has formally opposed BRI already. The fear of Chinese
encirclement -- both in the Indian Ocean through the “string of pearls” ports and overland
through the BRI economic corridors in Pakistan and Myanmar -- has prompted India to establish
its own connectivity initiatives such as the Kaladan project with Myanmar and the North-South
Transport Corridor with Russia.
As the India-China rivalry ramps up, Bangladesh is gradually becoming a key battleground,
featuring prominently in the Modi government’s counter-China policies like “Act East” and
“Neighbourhood First.”
Hence, Bangladesh cozying up to China is understandably causing jitters in India, which has
enjoyed exceptionally good relations with Bangladesh since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s
Awami League (AL) government came to power in 2009.
Hasina’s pro-India foreign policy was initially fruitful for both countries, strengthening security
cooperation, and resolving long-standing bilateral glitches such as maritime and land boundary
disputes.
But India’s domestic political opposition stymied Bangladesh’s long-anticipated Teesta water
sharing treaty. As a result, there is now a strong sense within the Bangladeshi intelligentsia that
the relationship with India is non-reciprocal.
This feeling further intensified during the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis, when India deliberately
supported the Myanmar government’s controversial approach towards the persecution of the
Rohingya and failed to provide any meaningful diplomatic assistance to Bangladesh, which
received more than 700,000 refugees.

8/C, FR Tower , Panthapath, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh.In the end, China came to Bangladesh’s partial rescue by brokering a rather weak repatriation
deal with Myanmar. The agreement has not yet been properly implemented, of course. But this
diplomatic intervention demonstrates China’s ambition to undermine India’s position as a
regional influencer.
For Bangladesh, India’s weakened position in the region could bring unexpected boons. Hasina
has successfully snubbed any domestic critics accusing her of giving into India’s infringements
on Bangladesh -- a popular anxiety that runs deep through Bangladeshi society.
By representing China as one of several infrastructure development partners along with Japan and
South Korea, and simultaneously maintaining India as a silent international backer, the Hasina
government is tactfully leveraging Bangladesh’s position in the face of a China-India strategic
rivalry.
Bangladesh is deeply aware that both India and China will be primarily self-serving in their
investments in the country. One way of getting the most out of the India-China competition is to
remain elusive with respect to showing preference between the two giants.
Maintaining healthy working relations with both India and China is crucial for an economically
and infrastructurally weak Bangladesh.
In the future, if the India-China strategic rivalry intensifies, it will have significant consequences
for Bangladesh. For now, though, Bangladesh is likely to continue its balancing act.

The days of multi-billion-dollar BRI investments from China are very likely over. The
bureaucratic delays and funding cuts that hamstrung the Establishing Digital Connectivity
project help show why. This is the final part of the series
Adam Pitman
Update : 27 Jun 2022, 12:08 PM
In late April, the Information and Communication Technology Division and China Railway
International Group representatives signed a contract to implement the Establishing Digital
Connectivity project.[1][2]
Publish : 27 Jun 2022, 12:48 AM
x25/05/2025, 14:18 What one BRI project shows us about China’s investment in Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/273312/what-one-bri-project-shows-us-about-china’s 1/7The project will provide last-mile digital connectivity in parts of Bangladesh by 2024.[3][4][5][6]
China Railway International, a subsidiary of the state-owned China Railway Group Limited, will
build 10 digital village stations to provide broadband access to thousands of rural people, and
10,000 computer labs as part of Digital Bangladesh’s Sheikh Russel Digital Labs initiative. 
China Railway will also build a 21-story skyscraper in Purbachal a planned city 14km north-west
of Gulshan, which will house a training lab for ICT Division employees, and entrepreneurs, as
well as dozens of specialized labs at public universities across the country. 
China’s Economic Counselor in Dhaka, Liu Zhenhua, said the project stands as a new symbol of
the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Bangladesh, according to a Chinese-language Sohu article.
[7]
He was right. And in more ways than one.
The project took nearly six years and $550 million in budget cuts to implement. Few would have
predicted that outcome when Beijing and Dhaka announced the project in 2016. 
But it is an outcome that is becoming more common around the world. And the project’s story
helps explain why Bangladesh is unlikely to see more multi-billion-dollar BRI investments any
time soon. 
Beijing, Dhaka took nearly six years to realize the project
When Beijing announced the BRI in 2013, it looked like an unstoppable juggernaut to many. 
At that time, China’s investment into Bangladesh was comparatively modest for an economy of
its size; its investment concentrated in energy and ready-made-garments.[8]
That changed dramatically after China’s leader Xi Jinping visited Dhaka in October 2016.
The president’s advance team descended upon Dhaka. Government ministries and companies
scrambled to flesh out memoranda of understanding (MoUs). And after the dust settled, China
was committed to 27 BRI projects -- valued at US $24bn -- on paper.[9]
The Establishing Digital Connectivity project was one of these projects. 
 x25/05/2025, 14:18 What one BRI project shows us about China’s investment in Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/273312/what-one-bri-project-shows-us-about-china’s 2/7Few news agencies singled-out the project; its planned $1bn contract was smaller than higher
profile power and transportation projects announced at the same time.[10][11]
But in the years after Xi’s visit, Beijing and Dhaka only implemented some of the 27 projects.
[12] Dhaka scrapped and swapped BRI projects that had reached a dead-end. Other MoUs
expired.
Tom Baxter, Global China Editor of China Dialogue, told the Dhaka Tribune: “If forces aren't
well aligned for Chinese companies to make money, high-level statements of intent won't really
get off the ground.
“Those statements are often intended to guide investments into an area that's of strategic interest
to the two governments, but the reality is, if there aren't feasible, bankable, profitable projects
available, there won't be much movement,” Baxter explained. 
Establishing Digital Connectivity did not generate much momentum after 2016. 
The project reflected Beijing’s interest in building a “Digital Silk Road,” a part of the BRI. And it
reflected Dhaka’s interest in establishing a Digital Bangladesh. But it did not promise the kind of
downstream revenue a Chinese company could bank over the long term.[13]  
And the project was not mentioned by the media again until May 2018, when the Cabinet
Committee on Economic Affairs approved the project for direct procurement, fast-tracking the
tender process.[14]
China Railway International won the bid; it signed an agreement with the ICT Division for the
project in October 2018 --exactly two years after the initial MoU.[15] Dhaka appears to have
approved the agreement just over a year later in November in 2019, followed by Beijing in March
2020.[16]
Then, Dhaka needed to secure the financing for the project from Beijing. What followed was
nearly two years of negotiations over cutting the project’s budget. 
Project budget cut four times since 2020
Between June 2020 and April 2022, the project’s contract value shrank by more than half -- from
$1bn to $450m. Mir Mostafizur Rahaman followed the story in The Financial Express. 
 x25/05/2025, 14:18 What one BRI project shows us about China’s investment in Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/273312/what-one-bri-project-shows-us-about-china’s 3/7The first budget cut appeared in June 2020, when a finance ministry official told Rahaman the
project was one of 17 projects Dhaka requested Beijing to finance on priority.[17][18] Dhaka’s
priority list, shown to Rahaman, put the project’s value at US $837 million. 
While the budget cut was not explained, it followed a Bangladesh-China Investment Cooperation
Working Group meeting that had occurred months earlier.[19]  
In March 2021, an ICT Division official told Rahaman that the project was valued at $694m;
Beijing would provide 65% of the total project cost, while Dhaka would provide the
remainder. [20][21][22]
Just months later, in June 2021, finance ministry sources said the project’s value was lowered to
$473m -- so that Dhaka could obtain financing from Beijing more easily.[23]
Dhaka reportedly achieved the budget cuts in 2021 by lowering the number of Sheikh Russel
Digital Labs and specialized university labs, as well as dropping two potentially sensitive
components -- digitalizing the foreign ministry, and a Point of Interconnect for the national
broadband network.
When the project was approved for implementation in April 2021, its budget was set at US $450
million, with Beijing providing 80% of the total project cost, and Dhaka providing the
remainder. 
Notably, the project’s implementation was preceded by months of reporting that described
Dhaka’s uncertainty over whether Beijing would finance the project, among others. 
Covid-19, and the resulting economic slowdown in China, had pumped the brakes on the BRI. 
Christoph Nedopil Wang, Founding Director at the Green Finance and Development Centre, and
Associate Professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, described this slowdown in The
China Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Investment Report 2021.[24]
“Compared to 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese engagement declined by
about $53bn -- about 48%” globally, according to the report, which also found that China’s BRI
investment was at its slowest pace since Beijing announced the initiative in 2013.
These broader trends help explain why Beijing may have slow-walked Dhaka’s requests for
project financing between 2020 and 2022 -- and why Dhaka had to work so hard to secure the
financing. 
A new symbol of the BRI in Bangladesh
x25/05/2025, 14:18 What one BRI project shows us about China’s investment in Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/273312/what-one-bri-project-shows-us-about-china’s 4/7The Establishing Digital Connectivity project implemented in April was smaller and less
expensive than many expected when it was announced in October 2016. 
Future BRI projects in Bangladesh are likely to follow a similar scale, budget, and timeline. 
Nedopil Wang found the average BRI deal size was $476m last year, which is approximately 21%
smaller than the average deal size in 2015. Moreover, he found that the total number of BRI
investments are decreasing relative to construction projects year-on-year. 
Those trends will likely become more pronounced after new guidelines issued by Beijing. 
Late last year, Beijing called for “high-quality BRI development,” encouraging companies to
pursue contracts in new sectors, such as healthcare, green energy, and ICT, and introduced new
environmental and social impact requirements for companies seeking approvals and financing for
BRI projects. [25][26]
The new guidelines and compliances will change the way companies and banks from China
assess proposed BRI projects, and as a result, Dhaka may need to start prioritizing projects that
are smaller, greener, and cheaper, if it would like to secure support from China in the future. 
But the days of multi-billion-dollar power and transport BRI investments in Bangladesh are very
likely over. Instead, the BRI will be defined by projects like Establishing Digital Connectivity --
multi-million-dollar construction projects that companies can build and turn-over quickly.

Bangladesh needs  China for its rapid industrialisation: Shahriar Alam

Former State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam on Wednesday said Bangladesh
needs China for its rapid industrialisation and noted the significant role that China has
played over the last 15 years.
“Industrialised Bangladesh needs China,” he said, noting that Bangladesh-China relations
have been deepened over the last decade, reports UNB.
Delivering his opening remarks at a roundtable discussion, Shahriar recalled the historical
facts during the Liberation War but recognised Chinaʼs contributions over the last one and a
half decades.
The lawmaker said there is no reason to compare Bangladeshʼs relations with India and
China. Shahriar remembered the historic role of India and shared sacrifice during the
Liberation War in 1971.
He expressed displeasure over the propaganda centering on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinaʼs
recent State visit to India.
Bangladesh Foundation for Regional Studies (BFRS) hosted the discussion moderated by
PMʼs former Special Assistant Barrister Shah Ali Farhad.

Raheed Ejaz, among others, were present.
There are new avenues that have been opened which came up for discussion including
export diversification and a possible free trade agreement (FTA).
BIISS Research Director Dr Mahfuz Kabir presented a paper at the beginning of the
discussion.
Although Bangladesh-China diplomatic relations were established officially in January
1976, bilateral relations reached a new height since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took
office for the second term in January 2009, according to a concept note.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinaʼs visits to China in 2010 and 2014 laid the foundation for the
current warm relations between the two countries, it said.
Chinese President Xi Jinpingʼs historic visit to Bangladesh in 2016 elevated the relations
between the two countries to a “strategic partnership of cooperation”.
During the said visit, the two countries signed 21 agreements worth around US$ 40 billion.
China has become a dependable partner of Bangladesh in terms of infrastructure
development, having collaborated on such major projects as the Padma Bridge, the
Karnaphuli River Underwater Tunnel, etc. So far, China has helped Bangladesh build 21
bridges, 11 highways covering 550 km of roads, and 27 energy and power projects, with
numerous more projects in the development and/or planning stages.
Trade too is flourishing between the two countries. China implemented duty-free facilities
on 97% of Bangladeshi products on 1 July 2020. Later, it was increased to 98%.
In the 2022-23 fiscal year, China was Bangladeshʼs single largest trading partner, with
bilateral trade amounting to US$ 24 billion, of which Bangladeshʼs exports amounted to
US$ 677 million and imports amounted to US$ 22.9 billion.
Minister of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee Liu Jianchao,
during his recent visit to Dhaka, expressed optimism that the forthcoming visit of Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina to China would be a very fruitful one.
“I think that the forthcoming visit by the Prime Minister is going to be a very fruitful one,” he
told reporters after his meeting with Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud.
“So we do have a lots of expectations, and I am sure that our two governments and
government agencies will work out a general plan for the cooperation between our two
countries in time to come,” said the Chinese minister.
He said they had a very in-depth and comprehensive discussion on bilateral relations, the
history of the relationship, and friendship.
“Thus, the friendship was cemented throughout these years, nearly fifty years after …since
our bilateral relation was established in 1975,” Jianchao said.
He said China shares the interest and also the very strong inspiration, and enthusiasm in
working with Bangladesh in its drive for prosperity, for example, the Vision-2041 and also
the goal to achieve a Smart Bangladesh.
“China remains a brand as a neighbour and a partner for your modernisation drives. So, we
will do it within the framework of Belt and Road Initiative,” he added.

In 2019, the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, appealed
to Aung San Suu Kyi to ""open your eyes, listen, feel with your heart, and please use your
moral authority before it is too late."" Prof. Lee was referring to a newly published report byBN

remaining in Myanmar, who were described as being at ""serious risk of genocide.""
Since then a lot of water of rivers in Myanmar has flowed into the Bay of Bengal. The world
has watched the evolving scenario with great interest - particularly because of the judicial
paradigm in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. There has also been
careful international scrutiny and monitoring in Geneva and New York in the corridors of
the United Nations.
In this context one is reminded also of former UK Prime Minister David Cameron's recently
released memoirs, in which he recalls his meeting in London in October 2013 with
Myanmar's leader Suu Kyi. When Cameron told her ""the world is watching,"" her only
response was ""they are not really Burmese. They are Bangladeshis,"" thus repeating the
racist accusation that the Rohingya are illegal interlopers from Bangladesh and do not
belong to Myanmar.
It would be important at this point to note that the world knows that Suu Kyi's civilian
government has little authority over matters of security, and is unable to order the
Myanmar military to halt further operations or alter the way in which they are conducted in
the Rakhine State of Myanmar. It is nevertheless acknowledged by everyone that Suu Kyi
holds power over the political discourse in the country and certain aspects of international
relations. However, she has continuously opted to use her government's power to support
the military campaign against the Rohingya, block international efforts to investigate and
document events on the ground. Instead her support has always been for the Buddhist-
nationalist narratives used to justify banishment of the Rohingya from the country of their
birth.
It was against such a background that Bangladesh watched with great care the recent two-
day (January 17-18)  state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Myanmar. Analysts
realised that this visit would be much more than symbolic. It would set the course of the
future bilateral relations between the two countries and also define Myanmar's geo-
economic future.
This was the Chinese leader's first foray abroad in 2020 and the first visit to Myanmar by a
Chinese president in almost two decades, since Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit in
2001. It also reflected the significance Beijing places on its relations with its southern
neighbour.
The pre-trip briefing to journalists and diplomats in Beijing given by Vice-Foreign Minister
Luo Zhaohui stressed the importance of China's bilateral relations with Myanmar, and said
that the two countries would seek closer economic and trade cooperation through the Belt25/05/2025, 12:25 China exchanges visiting cards with Myanmar but Rohingya repatriation takes back seat   | The Financial Express

Rakhine, would form part of the visit's bilateral dialogue.
This led the world in general and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and
Bangladesh in particular to wait and watch what might eventually appear in the Joint
Statement that would be issued on  January 18 from Naypyidaw on the conclusion of the
visit. This monitoring brought forth several expected denotations and connotations.
SUMMIT OUTCOME: Leaders of both the countries signed 33 agreements shoring up key
projects that are part of Beijing's flagship BRI.
They agreed to hasten implementation of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, a giant
infrastructure scheme worth billions of dollars, with agreements on railways linking
southwestern China to the Indian Ocean, a deep-sea port in conflict-ridden Rakhine state, a
special economic zone on the border, and a new city project in the commercial capital of
Yangon. Completion of the projects will mean faster and more reliable delivery of crucial
energy supplies to China from the Middle East and Africa while increasing Chinese
infrastructure and investment opportunities. For Myanmar there will be development and
jobs.
China has been Myanmar's main finance and trade partner and provider of weapons during
decades of junta rule and Western sanctions until 2010, when political and economic
reforms to spur development were announced. Investment from Japan, the United States
and South Korea, among others, began pouring in and Beijing's influence waned. At that
juncture came the clampdown in Rakhine, a backlash from the West, and a fresh
resurgence in ties. With China now Myanmar's biggest investor and trading partner and
source of tourists, and high-level visits of officials increasingly common, the friendship on
show during Xi's visit bodes well for closer relations between the two countries.
Myanmar's embracing of the BRI in 2018 was a significant contributor to better ties. That
year, the two sides signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to jointly build the
corridor. Chinese media has also been suggesting that with closer ties and promised
development has created the possibility of settling Myanmar's ethnic disputes to ensure
stability, improve cross-border transport links and through its membership of the ASEAN
countries, boosting regional relations. By moving closer, there will be mutual benefit
through greater development and prosperity. Once the US$1.3 billion Kyaukpyu port is
complete on the Bay of Bengal, it will also give Beijing another link to oil supplies from the
Middle East. Kyaukpyu is at one end of a massive oil and natural gas pipeline network that
runs to Kunming in China's southwest Yunnan province.25/05/2025, 12:25 China exchanges visiting cards with Myanmar but Rohingya repatriation takes back seat   | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/china-exchanges-visiting-cards-with-myanmar-but-rohingya-repatriation-takes-back-seat-1580048874 3/9The Joint Statement issued on the conclusion of the visit drew attention to the Chinese
President's meetings with Myanmar President U Win Myint and bilateral talks with State
Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi pertaining to the promotion of comprehensive strategic
cooperation based on the aims of mutual benefits and equality. However, it did not contain
any reference to his meeting held with General Min Aung Hlaing the Chief of the Myanmar
Armed Forces.
It was also indicated that both sides had agreed to step up the ""Belt and Road""
cooperation, push the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) to transit from concept
sketching into concrete development, and endeavour to promote the three pillars of the
CMEC, namely the Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone, Myanmar-China Border Economic
Cooperation Zones, and new urban development of Yangon City as well as framework
infrastructure projects of connectivity such as roads, railways, electric power and energy. It
was also clarified that they will not only deepen cooperation in economy and trade,
agriculture, forestry, industrial capacity, investment and finance for the benefit of both
peoples but also in the safeguarding of legitimate rights and interests, as well as national
dignity, on the international stage.
It was also clarified that both countries had agreed to continue to enhance coordination
and cooperation in regional and multilateral fora such as the United Nations, China-ASEAN
cooperation and Lancang-Mekong cooperation platforms. There was obviously a
connotative reference within this paradigm - particularly with the on-going efforts aimed at
repatriating to Myanmar the more than one million Rohingyas who have sought sanctuary
in Bangladesh after fleeing rape, arson and murder inside their homeland - the Rakhine
State in Myanmar.
RAKHINE ISSUE: The Joint Statement mentioned very carefully that the Chinese side
supports the efforts of Myanmar to address the humanitarian situation and to promote
peace, stability and development for ""all communities in Rakhine State"". Myanmar also
reiterated its commitment to receive ""verified displaced persons"" based on the bilateral
agreement reached between Myanmar and Bangladesh. The Chinese side reaffirmed its
willingness to provide further support, ""within its capacity, to Myanmar in the repatriation
process and resettlement of the displaced person from Rakhine State"". Myanmar thanked
China for its understanding of the ""complexity of the issue"" and for all its support to
Myanmar. It was however not clarified what actually took place in the discussion between
the two sides behind closed doors.
The hint, nevertheless, from the language was that this problem is still in square one. There
is also a subtle indication that the views expressed by the International Court of Justice at
The Hague might not draw clear subsequent support from China within the portals of the
United Nations, either in Geneva or in New York. This also re-affirmed that for Myanmar's25/05/2025, 12:25 China exchanges visiting cards with Myanmar but Rohingya repatriation takes back seat   | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/china-exchanges-visiting-cards-with-myanmar-but-rohingya-repatriation-takes-back-seat-1580048874 4/9diplomats, the Rakhine issue, especially the recent ICJ proceedings, has left the country
with no alternative but to turn to their Asian partners. Their efforts have paid dividends this
time round.
In the meantime, just ahead of the ruling by the International Court of Justice, the so-called
""Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE)"" set up by the Myanmar authorities released
the results of its probe on whether to impose urgent measures to stop alleged ongoing
genocide in Myanmar. The commission was established in June 2018 to investigate
allegations of human rights abuses during the 2017 crackdown. It conceded that some
security personnel had used disproportionate force and committed war crimes and serious
human rights violations, including the ""killing of innocent villagers and destruction of their
homes"". However, according to ICOE the crimes did not constitute genocide. The ICOE Panel
which included two local and two international members, Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo
and former Japanese ambassador to the UN Kenzo Oshima. According to them, there was ""
insufficient evidence to argue, much less conclude, that the crimes committed were
undertaken with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or
religious group."" It would however be pertinent to mention here that the UN Fact-finding
Mission on Myanmar, which had been denied entry to the country, concluded last year that
the panel was not an ""effective independent investigations mechanism.""
From this point of view, Professor Fan Hongwei's comment assumes particular importance 
- China's support of Myanmar's stance on the Rohingya issue will be crucial for Suu Kyi
before a general election in November, 2020 as the West withdraws or imposes sanctions
on that country following the ruling of the ICJ or any decision undertaken by the
International Criminal Court or the UN General Assembly or the UN Security Council.

China has emerged as one of the leading bilateral development partners of Bangladesh as
it disbursed US$460.41 million loans in the first half of the current fiscal year, insiders said
on Friday.BN
25/05/2025, 15:26 China's lending to Bangladesh surges | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/chinas-lending-to-bangladesh-surges-1611975747 1/8The world's second-largest economy over the last three and a half years has enhanced its
portfolio in Bangladesh with a steady growth in investments for the development work,
they said.
Deputy secretary of the Economic Relations Division (ERD) Syed Ashrafuzzaman told the FE
the Chinese investment for Bangladesh's development work has been significantly rising
since FY'2018.
In FY'2018, Bangladesh received US$978.6 million worth loans from China, compared to
only $64 million in FY2017, ERD statistics showed.
In the FY'2019, Beijing disbursed $515.08 million worth loa$695.5 million loans and grants,
down from in FY2020.
Bangladesh and China turned their relationship into a strategic partnership in October 2016
with a deal signed between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
As part of Chinese president Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing and Dhaka
signed deals worth some $21 billion for upgrading infrastructure, especially in transport,
power and IT sector.
China is financing ongoing mega projects such as Padma railway link, Dasherkandi water
treatment plant, the development of national ICT infra-network for Bangladesh
government phase III (Info-Sarkar), the construction of a tunnel under the river Karnaphuli,
and the installation of single point mooring (SPM) with the double pipeline.
China usually provides both concessional and costlier loans, including buyers' credit, to
finance development projects.
Former ERD secretary Kazi Shofiqul Azam told the FE that since many of the projects have
been implemented over the last few years with financial support from China, its aid
disbursement has picked up.
""Bangladesh government has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China
worth over $20 billion for implementing 27 development projects a few years back. Some of
the projects' execution from the list has already been started. Thus, the aid inflow is
maintaining a higher graph,"" he added.
Executive director of the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (SANEM) Dr Selim
Raihan said with the emergence of China as a leading lender, it is good for Bangladesh that
the aid dependence on the west has been decreasing over the years.25/05/2025, 15:26 China's lending to Bangladesh surges | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/chinas-lending-to-bangladesh-surges-1611975747 2/8Chinese financial support to Bangladesh's high-demanding infrastructure development
work is paving the way for boosting its development, he told the FE.
""You know that China has one belt one road intuitive. Besides, Dhaka and Beijing are the
partners of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor. So, it is expected that
Bangladesh will be getting higher assistance from Beijing in future too,"" he said.
Dr Raihan, also an economics professor of Dhaka University, noted that along with China's
enhanced financial support, the Bangladesh government has to ensure the governance in
project implementation.
But Dhaka needs an ""intelligent"" and ""wise"" negotiations with Beijing without super-
stringent terms while getting loans and to use the committed aid efficiently and
transparently for the development of the country, the SANEM ED said.
Dr Raihan has also suggested executing the China-funded projects in time to avoid time and
cost overrun.
A director of the China-funded project under the Power Division requesting anonymity told
the FE that China does not take too much time to get permission for different procurement
and project work.
""In most cases, we need to obtain approval from the multilateral and bilateral donors at
every stage of procurement. But it is comparatively easy for getting approval from China,""
he added.
Meanwhile, the ERD in its Aid Flow Book for last FY2019-20 said there has been an
increasing trend in the share of bilateral aid since FY2010-11.
""Some bilateral development partners such as China, Russia and India have become more
active in the global aid architecture. Bangladesh, like many other countries, has been
mobilising resources from these countries to fulfill its growing investment needs in the
large infrastructures projects,"" it said.
Bangladesh government is currently implementing some nine development projects with
Chinese loans totalling $7.1 billion.
The big projects are: Padma bridge rail link, a tunnel under the river Karnaphuli, power grid
network strengthening and the installation of single point mooring.
An MoU titled 'Strengthening and Production Capacity Cooperation' was signed between
Bangladesh and China comprising 27 investment projects under the $21 billion loan25/05/2025, 15:26 China's lending to Bangladesh surges | The Financial Express

Is Bangladesh at risk of falling into the
Chinese debt trap?
Mon Nov 8, 2021 12:00 AM
Last update on: Mon Nov 8, 2021 08:26 AM
Bangladesh, the second highest recipient of China's investment in South Asia
after Pakistan, imports the highest volume of goods from China, making the
country Bangladesh's largest trading partner. This is the beginning of the story
where China offers Bangladesh financial assistance and development experience
for its ""big-ticket megaprojects"" to fulfil the latter's ""Vision 2041""—a well-crafted
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Over the last two decades, the bilateral ties
between the two countries have grown from a trade relation to a strategic partnership. File Photo: Star
dream to be a developed country. However, the massive amount of funding from
China makes critics ask, citing the example of Hambantota in Sri Lanka: ""Is
Bangladesh getting entangled in China's 'debt trap' diplomacy?""
Debt-Trap Diplomacy, a widely used narrative against China, is thought to have
originated from the ""infrastructure war"" between China and the Western world.
It's an apple of discord regarding whether China really has any ""Machiavellian
strategy,"" as Chinese projects in Bangladesh are too fragmented to achieve such
cunning strategic objectives. Once ""the sleeping giant,"" now the ""second most
influential economic superpower,"" China follows socialist ideology in political
affairs, but adopts open market policies under the name of ""market socialism.""
The historical data demonstrates that China always has strong affiliation with the
South Asian countries because of the region's ""big bazaar."" The geopolitical
eminence and commercial noteworthiness of Bangladesh has made China pay
special attention to cash in on this money-making market.
To utilise the potential of becoming the ""economic hub"" of South Asia,
Bangladesh needs external funding for its flagship development projects, the
financing of which goes beyond domestic affordability. This has led to Bangladesh
looking for external funding options under conducive conditions. Bangladesh's
loss of substantial financial assistance from global lenders—e.g. World Bank's
rejection to finance the Padma Bridge—and the attractive nature of China's
investment created a gateway for the country to step into Bangladesh's economy.
On the other hand, China, as a part of its external orientation, comes closer to
Bangladesh by affiliating the country with different China-led regional platforms,
e.g. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
etc.
The Sino-Bangladesh relations, which began in 1976, were limited to trade deals
until the first decade of the 21st century. The bilateral relations have experienced
two different phases before and after the initiation of the BRI. The relations
turned into strategic partnership after 2010, when the countries signed a number
of trade, transit and defence procurement agreements. Both countries are
working to alleviate the huge trade-deficit by establishing free trade zones. China
is trying to prove itself as Bangladesh's time-tested friend by entwining
diplomatic, defence and economic ties.
Though Bangladesh and China have distinct political and social status quo,
collaborative efforts brought them closer. China's non-intervention principle to
the domestic affairs of its partners leads Dhaka to welcome more and more
investment from Beijing. As an emerging economy, Bangladesh requires hefty
investment to tackle its socioeconomic problems, which China can support. On
the other hand, Bangladesh is all-important in China's strategic calculus, since it
can connect the south-eastern landlocked province of China. Besides, the cheap
workforce of Bangladesh offers China an opportunity to relocate its sunset
industries. Yet, critics give a contentious look on this relationship by denouncing
China's role—or lack thereof—in resolving the Rohingya crisis.
According to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), that a
country will cross the danger mark if its external debts exceed 40 percent of GDP
ensures that Bangladesh is in the ""safe zone,"" as its total foreign loan is less than
15 percent of its GDP. ""Flow of External Resources into Bangladesh,"" a publication
by the Ministry of Finance, reported that the total outstanding foreign loan of the
country was nearly USD 44.06 billion, depicting per capita loan to be around USD
278 in 2019-20 fiscal year. This clearly shows how the reality differs from the
assumption that Bangladesh is overburdened with external debts. Another
misconception that Bangladesh is going to be a victim of the Chinese debt trap,
pointing the finger to the growing Chinese investment, also doesn't reflect the
ground reality. Of Bangladesh's total external debt in the 2019-20 fiscal year, 38
percent was from the World Bank, 24.5 percent from the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), 17 percent from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica), 6.81
percent from China, 6.14 percent from Russia, and 1.3 percent from India. This
data shows that Bangladesh is on the right trajectory.
The strategic advantage of cross-border trade tilted Bangladesh exponentially
towards China, which has led critics to say that too much reliance on China's
money will make Bangladesh beholden to it. But Bangladesh's diplomatic
manoeuvres of the last few decades demonstrate that the country has been
striking a fine balance among its donors. By pumping money into Bangladesh,
China is actually trying to take the longstanding relations to a new height. Albeit,
there is a narrative that Bangladesh is going to be a victim of ""payday loan
diplomacy,"" but the counter-narrative explains how Chinese soft loans reduce the
pressure of Western donors for economic and political reforms.
Bangladesh perceives Chinese investment as a welcome addition to existing
sources along with creating a competitive environment. Before reaching foregone
conclusions by tagging China's debt trap with Bangladesh, it needs to be
remembered that the funding options for Bangladesh are very limited. Besides, a
loan becomes a burden if it is not optimally utilised. To date, all the Chinese-
funded projects in Bangladesh have been proven to be financially viable. There is
no instance where Bangladesh has accepted all the diktats, while signing
financial agreements blindfolded.
The current stronger position of Bangladesh, in terms of external debt from
China, will alter with the rise of Chinese investment, but the long-run returns will
be more attractive if funds are effectively utilised. Bangladesh needs to negotiate
carefully before signing any financial agreement, focus more on soft loans, and
ensure timely implementation of projects. Along with taking funds for
infrastructural boost, Bangladesh may also leverage the development experience
of China to create a win-win situation. Not to mention, the macro-economic
management policy of Bangladesh is prudent enough to avoid China's debt trap,
even if there is one.

hope this weekly page will provide interesting perspectives to help our readers
The US' emphasis on promoting democracy in Bangladesh, primarily driven by the aim to counteract China's growing
influence in the country, will significantly influence India's stance on the 2024 elections in Bangladesh. Photo: Collected
understand the global challenges better. This article published in the first issue
focuses on exploring the global power play in Bangladesh's elections. –   Mahfuz
Anam, Editor & Publisher 
The recent presidential election in the Maldives reflected a theatre for India-
China competition, with the president-elect, Mohamed Muiz, making ""India out""
a central theme in his campaign. We also witnessed the two major powers
jockeying for influence in the Nepalese election in 2022. While the political
landscape in Bangladesh differs from that of its two South Asian neighbours, the
India-China contest remains a crucial factor. Over the course of the past 15 years,
both countries have deepened their stakes in Bangladesh, which is clearly evident
in the growing geopolitical tension surrounding the upcoming election.
China is now Bangladesh's largest trade partner, with bilateral trade currently
valued at $25 billion. Since joining China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2016,
China has committed over $38 billion in investments to Bangladesh. The country
is second among all sources of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Bangladesh.
Furthermore, during the current regime's tenure, China-Bangladesh defence
cooperation has reached unprecedented levels. China has maintained its position
as the chief supplier of light weapons to Bangladesh since the 1970s, with over 70
percent of Bangladesh's weapons procurement between 2015 and 2022 originating
from China, according to SIPRI. Notably, China has been instrumental in the
construction of Bangladesh's first submarine base, the BNS Sheikh Hasina, with a
total investment of $1.2 billion, located in Pekua within Cox's Bazaar.
China's approach to Bangladesh during the ruling Awami League's regime can be
summarised as bolstering economic ties while refraining from criticising
democratic backsliding in the country. China was the first country to welcome the
AL government after the one-sided 2014 elections, and it didn't hesitate to
congratulate them on their big win in the equally controversial 2018 elections.
Furthermore, unlike economic aid from the US and Europe, Chinese investments
in Bangladesh's infrastructure come without conditions related to human rights,
good governance, or democracy. As a result, this has allowed the AL government
to lessen its dependence on Western donors.
Regarding the forthcoming election, China has consistently adhered to a stance
that aligns with its overarching strategy, as aptly articulated by Chinese
Ambassador to Bangladesh, Yao Wen, who stated, ""Our policy always remains the
same. China never intervenes in other country's internal issues. I can say the
election is the internal affairs of Bangladesh. It has to be decided by the
Bangladesh people.""
China also opposes any external pressure exerted by the United States concerning
the election. This stance is endorsed at the highest level of Chinese leadership. On
August 23, 2023, during a meeting with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on the
sidelines of the BRICS summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated, according to a
readout from China's foreign ministry, that China supports Bangladesh in
""opposing external interference"" and that Beijing will collaborate with Dhaka to
mutually support their core interests.
In the upcoming election, if the ruling party emerges victorious, Chinese
influence may strengthen even further. Conversely, if the AL loses, and the
opposition BNP comes to power, there is relatively minimal risk for China to lose
its stake, given the historically favourable relations between BNP and China.
Now, let's delve deeper into India's interests in Bangladesh's upcoming election.
As its largest neighbour, India undeniably holds a substantial stake in the
electoral proceedings. The increasing asymmetrical power dynamics between
these two nations have brought this influence into sharper focus.
In his book titled ""1971-2021: Bangladesh-Bharat Shomporker Ponchash
Bochor"" (1971-2021: 50 years of Bangladesh-India relations), former Bangladeshi
Foreign Secretary Touhid Hossain has shed light on the nature of the deepening
political reliance on India. He articulates, ""It is widely believed that no one can
ascend to the throne of Bangladesh without India's approval. Statements
supporting this notion have emanated from senior political figures on occasion.
Many believe that India's consent is a prerequisite for appointments to key
positions within Bangladesh. India's direct involvement in legitimising the 2014
election is well-documented. It was so apparent that even the leaders of the
political party (the BNP), whose political foundation is rooted in anti-Indianism,
had to reach out to India in an attempt to gain favour ahead of the 2018 election,
although their endeavours ultimately yielded no success.""
India's growing influence has fostered stronger bilateral ties with the AL-led
Bangladesh government, characterised by terms like ""very special relationship,""
""golden chapter,"" and ""model for the entire region."" The AL government has
addressed India's security concerns, particularly access to northeastern India,
through connectivity projects and action against anti-India insurgent groups. In
return, India has steadfastly supported the AL government, overlooking
democratic setbacks in Bangladesh. As regards the upcoming election, a
significant portion of the Indian media and think tanks continue to advocate
support for the current regime.
Nevertheless, some experts believe that India has adopted a different stance
towards the 2024 elections.
Indicating this changed position, Indian columnist Arkoprabho Hazra wrote
in The Diplomat, ""India is taking a much more inclusive approach toward the
2024 Bangladesh national elections, rather than putting all its bets on the Awami
League as seen in the past.""
He emphasised that India has expressed interest in ensuring violence-free and
democratic national elections in Bangladesh, aligning with the US stance. Recent
discussions between Indian and US security establishments suggest, according to
Hazra, a potential collaborative effort on election issues. This marks a departure
from the 2018 elections when India and the US held divergent views.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Modi's swift congratulations to Prime Minister
Hasina for her victory helped alleviate international criticism of the election's
conduct.
Yet it is worth noting that India has refrained from publicly responding to the
growing pressure exerted by the United States on Bangladesh, including visa
measures, aimed at ensuring a free, fair, and participatory election.
Professor Ali Riaz offers three possible explanations for India's deliberate silence:
""Firstly, India may be comfortable with the existing political status quo, as
demonstrated by its tacit support for Prime Minister Hasina amid US concerns
about democratic erosion. Secondly, India might not oppose US pressure on
Bangladesh, recognising that it could make Hasina more dependent on India as a
mediator between her government and the United States. Lastly, India seems to
acknowledge its diminishing role in Bangladeshi politics amid the US-China
geopolitical rivalry, making it a secondary external actor in the region.""
Regardless of the reasons behind India's muted response, it's evident that the US
has shifted its perspective away from viewing the Bangladesh issue solely through
the Indian lens. Instead, its emphasis on promoting democracy in Bangladesh,
primarily driven by the aim to counteract China's growing influence in the
country, will significantly influence India's stance on the 2024 elections in
Bangladesh.
India finds itself in a complex and delicate position. There is unease over
Bangladesh's growing reliance on China for economic aid and infrastructure
development, at times straining the India-Bangladesh relationship. Additionally,
there is apprehension that excessive pressure from the US on election-related
matters could lead Bangladesh closer to China.
However, Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Centre's South Asia Institute,
suggested in an interview with Prothom Alo that the US believes India, by
leveraging its influence over Bangladesh, can steer it away from such an
alignment. Furthermore, the current regime in Bangladesh expects India to
advocate for Sheikh Hasina's government with the Biden administration.
India's response to these competing interests will be a pivotal factor in the
upcoming elections, the outcome of which carries significant implications not
only for Bangladesh but also for the Bay of Bengal region, a critical component of
the global geopolitical hotspot, the Indo-Pacific.

China is the major development partner of Bangladesh. It is frequently touted by the leaders of
both countries that Bangladesh and China need to maintain a strategic partnership.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/129104/so-which-of-the-favours-of-china-would-bangladesh 1/5Although China recognised Bangladesh four years after its independence, it is also a well-known
fact that Chinese-supported pro-Beijing communist party elements in Bangladesh, opposed the
Awami League-led, India-backed, and Moscow-endorsed Liberation War in 1971. China tried
hard to fish in the region’s troubled water before and during 1971 independence, but failed
miserably.
In an article titled “Maoism in Bangladesh and The Case of the East Bengal Sarbohara Party”
which was published by University of California Press in 1986, Md Nurul Amin documented a
fact that the pro-Beijing party was divided into more than a dozen factions before and during the
1971 Liberation War.
Later in 1972, China also gave its first veto in UN Security Council to bar Bangladesh from
membership in the United Nations. China considered the birth of Bangladesh as the most
insidious role of “the Soviet socialist imperialism” in South Asia.
The then Chinese chief representative at the United Nations, Huang Hua said: “The sole purpose
of Soviet socialist imperialism is to further control India and Bangladesh, to expand the spheres
of her influence and to bully Pakistan at will.” He also claimed that the Soviet Union had been
acting with “honey in mouth and dagger in heart.”
Therefore, ignoring the plight of Bangladesh is not new to the Chinese. The Rohingya crisis is a
burning example.
As expected, Chinese policy towards Bangladesh started to take a new turn when Pakistan -- an
all-weather friend to China -- formally recognised Bangladesh in 1974. The regime change by the

India influences and consequently, China and Bangladesh established the normal non-adversarial
diplomatic relationship at the beginning of 1976.
In 1977, President Ziaur Rahman’s visit to China opened the new window of bilateral
relationship.
At present, when China is a global economic superpower, the relationship between China and
Bangladesh is trade oriented. China enjoys a huge trade surplus with Bangladesh.
Last year Bangladesh imported $14 billion goods from China and exported as little as $800mn.
However, China considers Bangladesh as an important strategic partner for its Belt and Road
Initiative grand project involving BCIM corridor and the maritime silk route through the Bay of
Bengal.
On the other hand, Bangladesh considers China a development partner, since the current
government of Bangladesh is prioritising infrastructural development to make Bangladesh
business-friendly and to attract international trade and investments.
It has also become apparent that nearly half of our hard-earned foreign currencies from the
Western world are being channeled into China for enormously cheap purchases.
And the irony is, despite the fact that she had persuaded hostile policies against the birth of
Bangladesh, China is now gathering huge benefits in terms of business and geo+politics by
deluding the Bangladeshi intelligentsia with cheap Asian quality goods and Sun Tzu tactics.
Last year, Chinese President Xi visited Bangladesh and signed nearly $24bn in bilateral business
deals but after one year, it has been evaluated that there has been no significant progress upon the
soft loan of $21.5bn promised by China for 27 projects in Bangladesh.

much more interaction and connectivity.”
However, it is not clear yet why Bangladesh needs to be in BRI only if the country wants “quick
upgrade of infrastructure and connectivity,” when Bangladesh can explore the Bay of Bengal
region with diversified investments for her needs.
Confusing signals
China is exhibiting impeccable hypocrisy regarding the Rohingya genocide.
On the one hand, China has been endorsing the Myanmar army holocaust by saying that it is safe-
guarding peace and stability in this region. On the other hand, it is sending humanitarian aid to
the affected Rohingya who are also the victims of Chinese support for the ruthless establishment
of Myanmar.
China is also the biggest weapons exporter to Myanmar. Apparently, China has taken sides with
Myanmar by dodging Bangladesh in this region’s geo-political chessboard when Bangladesh is in
dire need of Chinese support to dismantle Myanmar’s “mass migration” plot.
There is an argument within the Bangladeshi intelligentsia regarding this Chinese policy to stand
with Myanmar -- that Bangladesh made a mistake by refusing to give the deep sea ports to the
Chinese in the Bay of Bengal region. If it was offered, China would have sided with Bangladesh
now.
This argument is completely unpatriotic and pro-Chinese, because it is Bangladesh who takes
decision regarding its assets and resources.
China has no right to drive a Machiavellian hostile policy to get the sea ports from Bangladesh.
Don’t trust thy neighbour
We must seek mutual respect when dealing with the Chinese, and at the same time, we must
remember that China is driving an imperial ambition.
Though she still denies it, China is in a huge panic-prone debt bubble. China is run by a military
dictatorship with a $200bn military budget per year. Fundamental human rights (including
freedoms of expression, assembly, association, and religion) remain dire in China -- Chinese
people hold strong nationalist, xenophobic, and racist views targetting other groups (Tibetans,
Uighurs, Japanese, South Koreans, Philippinos, Vietnamese, Rohingya, and more).x

and based on Marxism. Many argue that Chinese socialism is in fact Chinese Nazism, and
Chinese hypocrisy doesn’t make things better.
Currently, the Chinese communist party is meeting at the congress, and many Western analysts
suspect that this congress is going to be an event of supreme power consolidation of Xi Jinping as
the Chinese leader. He will be treated as the Mao of the 21st century.
The timing is important, because the US-led world order is suffering structural fatigue. Many
have been applauding the appearance of the Chinese dragon at the world’s centre stage.
But China doesn’t deserve it yet. Simply because the world shouldn’t replace a double-dealer
with a charlatan as its leader.
Therefore, Bangladesh must have, in addition to China, diverse partners for her infrastructural
developments.

'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and

DhakaPublished: 20 Dec 2021, 14: 34
Among the many challenges and opportunities unfolding before Bangladesh, the Belt and
Road Initiative looms large. A modern reincarnation of the old Silk Route, this concept
initiated by China also raises concerns, both regionally and internationally. Bangladesh, a
signatory to BRI, has many considerations to factor in as this mega-plan takes shape,
evolves and morphs along the way.Staff Correspondent
'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences'
25/05/2025, 10:30 'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences'
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/roundtable/bri-is-a-mega-plan-with-deep-geostrategic-and-geoeconomic-consequences 1/4These were observations made at the roundtable, ‘Belt and Road Initiative: Connecting the
World’ held on Sunday at a hotel in the capital. Organised jointly by Dhaka Tribune and
Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS), this was a part of a series of
discussions arranged by the two institutions on matters of current national, regional and
international issues.
Going back to the outset, Major General (retd) ANM Muniruzzaman, president of BIPSS,
said that the BRI concept was first floated by the Chinese president Xi Jinping in 2013
while visiting Kazakhstan. President Xi Jinping elaborated this further the next year in
Jakarta. Now 142 countries, including Bangladesh, have signed on to BRI till date.
“The BRI is estimated to cost up to 4 trillion dollars,” Maj Gen (retd) Muniruzzaman
pointed out, terming it as “a mega project, a grand strategy that will have deep
geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences.” Explaining the magnitude of the initiative,
he said, “BRI is structured on six economic corridors, two being corridors with maritime
reach. Bangladesh is on one of the maritime corridors, the BCIM EC (Bangladesh, China,
India and Myanmar Economic Corridor).”
He said that BRI aims to fill the huge infrastructure gap in countries of Asia, including
Bangladesh, as infrastructure is fundamental to the region’s development goals.
Listing the concerns raised about BRI, the BIPSS president said these included possible
debt traps, environmental sustainability of the BRI projects, corruption linked to the
projects in several countries, strategic concerns and so on.
Editor of Dhaka Tribune Zafar Sobhan expressed his view that as Bangladesh had
established its place in the world, BRI had brought both challenges and opportunities to
the fore. He said that this initiative would assist in shaping the geopolitics of the region in
particular, and the world as a whole. Bangladesh, like each signatory of BRI, would have to
take up the initiative to suit its own interests and requirements. He pointed out the need
to discern the pros and cons of BRI and take decisions accordingly.
Speaking as a panelist at the event, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue
(CPD), Fahmida Khatun said that as an emerging economy and a member of BRI, it wasBRI is estimated to cost up to 4 trillion dollars, a mega project, a
grand strategy that will have deep geostrategic and geoeconomic
consequences

https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/roundtable/bri-is-a-mega-plan-with-deep-geostrategic-and-geoeconomic-consequences 2/4important to see why this initiative is important to Bangladesh.
As Bangladesh had transformed from a least development country to a developing one,
she pointed out, the country was investing hugely in infrastructure and required
resources. “At present there is a huge gap between what we need and what we get,” she
said, “So we need a flow of investment. In Bangladesh the largest BRI projects were in the
energy and transport sectors and so BRI was meeting the gap.”
Fahmida Khatun also raised several concerns about BRI, including environmental issues
and the use of coal in energy projects, coal being considered the dirtiest energy. Another
concern was the eviction of people from their homesteads to make way for roads and
railways. Even with compensation, people were reluctant to shift from their ancestral
lands. Transparency in the procurement process of many projects was also a matter of
concern.
Assistant professor of economics at East West University and a panelist at the event,
Parvez Karim Abbasi, highlighted the issues lesser discussed about BRI.
Why did BRI come about, he posed the question, explaining that it was about giving the
people an idea of a better tomorrow. Chinese president Xi Jinping had become a most
influential leader and the BRI vision enhanced his image. The confrontation with the West
served to raise his popularity further among his people.
Addressing the concern on debt dynamics, he said that the Chinese way of business was
different from the Western way of business. It had become the financier of last resorts and
spends 85 billion US dollars annually in this regard. There was a huge demand for
infrastructure and loans often became onerous. Chinese used a debt-driven model which
much of the loans being provided by its state-owned banks.
BRI had just emerged from infancy and was in its adolescence, so as to say, Parvez Karim
Abbasi observed.
The discussion was followed by questions, answers and comments by the audience
comprising foreign diplomats, present and former civil servants, retired military officers,
academics, members of the civil society, journalists and others.The Chinese way of business was different from the Western way of

The changing dynamics of China-
Bangladesh relations
Sun Nov 11, 2018 12:00 AM
Last update on: Sun Nov 11, 2018 12:43 PM
Right from the beginning of their diplomatic ties in October 1975, China and
Bangladesh have been maintaining a close relationship, often entitled as ""trusted
friendship"" or ""all-weather friendship"". While, for decades, their bilateral
relations have primarily been focused on trade and defence cooperation, the
ongoing pattern projects a gradual extension of this mutual cooperation to
political, social, cultural, and maritime sectors as well. In recent years, China's
PM Sheikh Hasina with Chinese President Xi Jinping. PHOTO: STAR
assistance to Bangladesh in all these arenas has heightened significantly, whereas
Chinese investments on Bangladesh's infrastructure, power, energy, and
telecommunications are noteworthy.
Given these developments, Chinese President Xi Jinping's announcements about
the ""Belt and Road Initiative"" in the late 2013 has paved a new dimension in
China-Bangladesh relations, where  Bangladesh stands as an important partner in
both the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
Bangladesh has emerged as one of the important hubs of maritime as well as
overland connectivity between the Indian Ocean and the landlocked provinces of
China, especially Yunnan, which turned this bilateral relationship into a larger
win-win context.
If we take a brief look at the background of China-Bangladesh bilateral relations,
it can be assumed that their traditional relations were based on trade and military
cooperation. Since 1975, China-Bangladesh bilateral relations significantly
started with developing trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries. China became Bangladesh's principle trade partner in 2005 in terms of
imports, most notably trade in defence sectors, including the supply of
armaments, military hardware, and other special equipment. The Sino-
Bangladesh closer military cooperation was finely tuned by the signing of the
""Defense Cooperation Agreement"" in 2002 in the area of military training and
defence production, which was the first of its kind for Bangladesh. In the course
of time, Bangladesh now stands as the world's second largest importer of Chinese
military equipment after Pakistan.
China-Bangladesh traditional relationship reached a new height with China's
President Xi Jinping's two-day landmark visit to Bangladesh in October, 2016,
which was widely dubbed as a ""historic state visit"", beginning of a ""new horizon"",
or ""a new historical starting point"" of China-Bangladesh relations. Though both
countries witnessed several state-level visits by senior officials from both sides in
the previous 42 years of their diplomatic relations, a Chinese president's visit to
Bangladesh eventually marked a watershed in the bilateral relations of these two
countries. During this visit, both the countries have agreed upon furthering their
cooperation in various areas, such as, overland and maritime connectivity,
infrastructure development, industrial capacity cooperation, energy and power,
transportation, information and communication technology, agriculture, and so
on.
Hence, notably, one of the key changing dimensions of China-Bangladesh
relations in the twenty-first century is the cooperation in regional as well as sub-
regional connectivity. Though the two countries' cooperation in the area of
connectivity began in 1999 following the initiation of the Kunming Initiative that
was later renamed the China-Bangladesh-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor
(BCIM-EC), the inauguration of the ""Belt and Road Initiative"" (BRI) in 2013
attaches greater importance to the enhancement of China-Bangladesh bilateral
relations in that regard. Bangladesh officially joined BRI during President Xi's
visit in 2016. Bangladesh perceives the BRI as an enormous opportunity to attain
its national development goals of becoming a middle-income country by 2021 and
a developed country by 2041. Moreover, under the BRI framework, both sides
have agreed to work upon realising sustainable development and common
prosperity. The visit also renders the development of China-Bangladesh relations
through cultural exchanges and people-to -people connectivity.
The bilateral agreements during this visit have also enhanced China-Bangladesh
bilateral relations in terms of trade and investment putting their relations on a
new footing. Since the visit, Dhaka and Beijing have signed eight projects worth
over USD 9.45 billion funded by China. Padma Bridge rail link worth USD 3.3
billion, the power plant in Payra worth USD 1.9 billion, establishing digital
connectivity worth USD 1 billion, power grid network strengthening project
worth USD 1.32 billion, are the major projects that are being processed with
Chinese investments. All these financial assistance through investment have
surpassed the previous records of Chinese investments in Bangladesh. To
summarise it, China's USD 38 billion investment in Bangladesh, in combination
with USD 24.45 billion in bilateral assistance for infrastructure projects and USD
13.6 billion in joint ventures in addition to the USD 20 billion in loan agreements
that were made soon after the visit of President Xi, is the largest amount of
financial assistance ever pledged to Bangladesh by any one single country.
Besides, China's express of interest in participating in Bangladesh's ""blue
economy"" during this state-visit has steered the long-standing China-Bangladesh
relationship towards a promising direction. Being one of the significant littoral
states of the Indian Ocean as well as its enormous geo-strategic opportunities in
the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh's interest in being connected to China's landmark
21st Century Maritime Silk Road under BRI has boosted maritime cooperation
between the two countries.
Most importantly, China-Bangladesh ""strategic partnership of cooperation,""
instead of ""comprehensive partnership of cooperation,"" injects new impetus into
the relationship. This new type of strategic partnership signifies intensive
engagements and heightened cooperation on all the issues related to mutual
interest and common prosperity, such as political, economic, cultural, and
security issues at bilateral, regional and global levels along with other regional
and international affairs.
China-Bangladesh relations are going through a change in the 21st Century with
wider scope of mutual cooperation and benefits. The bilateral relation is now
stronger and more proactive than before. Both countries are now expected to
further enhance their ties under the umbrella of the Belt and Road Initiative.

ʻBangladesh can’t wait forever to resolve
the Teesta issue’
Mon Sep 5, 2022 07:41 PM
Last update on: Tue Sep 6, 2022 04:17 PM
Dr Im tiaz Ahmed, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, talks
about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ongoing visit to India and what to expect in
the future of Bangladesh-India relations in an interview with Shuprova
Tasneem of The Daily Star.
Will importing fuel from Russia be a major talking point during the prime
minister's trip, and can that affect our relationship with other nations?িতা  িনেয়  খালাখুিল  আেলাচনা  হওয়া  উিচত িতা  িনেয়  খালাখুিল  আেলাচনা  হওয়া  উিচত
In light of the Covid pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, there will definitely
be a focus on energy security. India still has a relationship with Russia and has
not looked into sanctions the way the West wanted. Bangladesh would definitely
want to learn how we can benefit from this relationship.
At the same time, one should know that any energy insecurity in Bangladesh
would also become a problem for the West. Our main export markets for ready-
made garment (RMG) products are in the US and Europe. If we suffer from energy
insecurity and it costs us more to produce RMG products, it will also increase
their costs and reduce their profit margins. So I believe it will be a win-win
situation for all if we can resolve our energy problems, either through a good
relationship with Russia by purchasing directly, or through help from India,
particularly when it comes to payment and other mechanisms.
How important is Bangladesh in India's Look East Policy, especially given
India's current relationship with China?
The importance depends on how much honey there is in the pot. If there is more
instability and less economic development, this interest will fizzle out. Ultimately,
geopolitics does not create human beings – it's human beings who create
geopolitics. Bangladesh's growth momentum over the last 15-20 years, despite the
obstacles faced, is what makes other countries interested in us, including India.
Bangladesh has by now managed to convince the world that what we are
interested in is economic development. It comes from our long-cherished goal of
becoming a peaceful country – a goal that was set by the father of the nation. So
whether we have ties with India, China, Japan, the US or Russia – all of it is based
on an economic relationship, not security or military development. At the same
time, Bangladesh guarantees that we would not allow anyone to use our territory
against anyone else. That's what leads to favourable ties with Dhaka regardless of
who is in power in India, because the current regime has made good on this
promise, especially in terms of dealing with insurgency coming from the
northeast. So I don't think Delhi or Beijing have any worries over Bangladesh's ties
with others, since a military alliance is never on the cards.

PM Hasina’s India visit: Will our expectations be met?
There are some concerns that Bangladesh is too dependent on trade with India
when it comes to essential goods. What is your view on this?
No country would want to be dependent on one source. We've had hiccups in this
regard, especially in terms of onion import, which forced us to look to Egypt and
Pakistan. We have already opened a channel with Russia for wheat, so I don't
think this is really an issue. The problem is that whenever we discuss trade or
connectivity, we fall back on traditional linkages and use a piecemeal approach.
Political will is required to look at the bigger picture. To this date, we have not
been able to mainstream technology and talk about creating new structures. For
example, we are currently discussing updating railway structures from the British
era. But with the existing technology, it's not difficult to think of a high-speed
train between Dhaka and Delhi. There are countries that have changed their
entire geographical composition like this, such as China. So why are we not
thinking about this?
The first thing that needs to change is our mindset. We are very conservative
when it comes to planning and investing in long-term projects. The fact that India
spends huge resources on the conflict with Pakistan could be part of this. There
are an estimated half a million troops in Kashmir alone, it's unthinkable. But
beyond the funding, there is also a lack of imagination. Technology has given us
the opportunity to not be slaves to geography, and we should take advantage of
that. The possibilities in this region are immense.
While there are talks of other water-sharing treaties, we are still no closer to a
resolution on the Teesta.
I can't speak for the policymakers, but it's possible they think that if we go
forward with other water-sharing agreements, we can tone down the issue of
Teesta and return to it later. But if we fail to resolve the Teesta issue and go ahead
with other agreements, then there will of course be criticism, and the
government will have to deal with that. One estimate suggests that the livelihoods
of 20 million people are impacted by the Teesta River. If we keep their concerns
hanging for so long, despite there even being a draft agreement, and move on to
other rivers that don't impact as many people, it will definitely become a political
and a partisan issue.
So why is the Teesta issue not being resolved? We need to have frank discussions
with Delhi on the factor that is Sikkim. There are 30-32 small and big dams for
hydroelectric power that are estimated to be affecting around five percent of
water flow in each of the dams, according to one eminent Indian hydrologist,
leading to a lean seasonal flow draining into Bangladesh. Mamata Banerjee's
contention around Teesta is all about this – not considering Sikkim in the
calculations.
Will they deconstruct the dams? Of course not. But Bangladesh can try to solve
this by storing rain/floodwater from the rainy season and letting it flow during
winter. There are environmental and monetary costs: one calculation suggests it
will be around USD 1 billion. Although China showed some interest, India
immediately became fearful of it. One way to resolve this is by creating a
consortium where different stakeholders can provide the funding and expertise
for this infrastructure. India must accept that Bangladesh will not wait forever to
resolve this issue.

Understanding the proposed Bangladesh-India
Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)
Will Myanmar an d the Rohingya refugees be a part of the discussions in Delhi?
Definitely. The point that some of us are also raising is, now that there are talks
about a tripartite engagement on the Rohingyas between China, Myanmar and
Bangladesh, why can't Delhi organise the same? That is something I think our
prime minister would flag this time, especially since we have not seen much
progress on this issue. Given that India has good relationships with both
Bangladesh and Myanmar, it can play a critical role. Take, for example, Turkey's
involvement in talks between Russia and Ukraine to open a Black Sea corridor for
the export of grains, which helped it become one of the big players when it comes
to negotiations in this conflict. Playing a similar role in the Rohingya issue could
also boost India's global status. This is especially pertinent now after the two ICJ
judgments recognising the ""Rohingya"" identity and the US calling the Myanmar
military actions against the Rohingyas a ""genocide.""
Why have we stopped talking about border killings?
This is very unfortunate. If a smuggler is not armed, you can arrest him, but
killing him is not permitted under the Indian Constitution or the international
law. And then there are the killings of civilians like 15-year-old Felani Khatun.
Yet, during the Galwan dispute on the India-China border, not a single shot was
fired. Why is that? Because of a 1996 agreement between China and India that
stipulates no-one can carry firearms for two kilometres on each side of the
border. So if this can be done there, why can't it be done on our borders?

Update : 25 A ug 2023, 05:19 PM
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen has said the Johannesburg meeting between Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina and Chinese President Xi Jinping showcased for one more time to the
world the example of relations between developing countries jointly set up by Bangladesh and
China.
“It was the first face-to-face meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina since the latter’s formal visit to China four years ago. We have long been waiting for this
meeting. It would definitely tide up new momentum for our bilateral relations,” he said in his first
interview since arrival in Dhaka, noting that it is his sacred mission to fully implement the
consensus reached by the two leaders to push the Strategic Partnership of Cooperation between
the two countries to a new level.
As briefed by Ambassador Yao, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and President Xi Jinping spoke
highly of the traditional friendship and good relations between Bangladesh and China based on
mutual respect and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.
They reassured mutual support on issues of respective core interests.
Satisfied by joint achievements made under the umbrella of Belt and Road cooperation, the two
leaders vowed to further strengthen the integration of development strategies, deepen practical
cooperation in various fields, and enhance all-round exchanges, so as to bring more benefits to
their people.
During this meeting held on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, Bangladesh showed interest in
strengthening cooperation with China in the bloc and other multilateral mechanisms.
The Chinese leader congratulated Bangladesh on joining the New Development Bank, and vowed
to enhance coordination and cooperation with Bangladesh in multilateral affairs to safeguard
international fairness and justice and serve the common interests of developing countries.
“From the minute of the meeting, all we read is mutual support and joint cooperation, with no
hint of any difference,” said Yao, stressing that interactions between top leaders provide political
and strategic guidance for the development of bilateral relations, the importance of which would
never be exaggerated.Publish : 25 A ug 2023, 05:19 PM25/05/2025, 14:55 Envoy: PM Hasina-Xi talks exemplify strong ties between developing nations
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/323493/envoy-pm-hasina-xi-talks-exemplify-strong-ties 2/8“It is high on my agenda to facilitate more in-person visits and meetings of this kind in the days
to come,” he added.
Relations in challenging situations
Ambassador Yao said China and Bangladesh share significant commonalities in terms of moral
values, national dreams and development paths.
“Since President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina jointly upgraded our bilateral
relations to Strategic Partnership of Cooperation in 2016, we have set a model of friendly ties
between developing countries for the world at large,” he said.
China now stands as the single largest trade partner and a key development partner of
Bangladesh. “Wherever I go in Bangladesh, the local people would always give me thumbs-up
for China-Bangladesh friendship,” the ambassador said.
At international arenas, China and Bangladesh both stand for peace and development. “We share
similar views on hotspot issues like the Ukraine crisis. China’s effort to help resume Saudi-Iran
diplomatic relations was also welcomed in Bangladesh,” he said.
“China is working with Bangladesh in meeting regional and global challenges, such as the
repatriation of displaced people from Rakhine State of Myanmar, tackling climate change,
upholding the right to development, and supporting the UN peacekeeping efforts,” the envoy
added.
“Based on equal footing, mutual respect, joint development and common commitment to peace,
relations between China and Bangladesh infuse the power of certainty and stability to an
increasingly trembling world,” he said.
Non-Intervention in Upcoming Election
“China supports Bangladesh in safeguarding national sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity,” President Xi said in the Johannesburg meeting, adding that China upholds
Bangladesh’s efforts to fend off external interference and maintain domestic unity and stability,
so as to ensure development and revitalization.
Yao said the upcoming election is an internal affair of Bangladesh, and their policy is very
consistent that China never intervenes in any country’s internal affairs.25/05/2025, 14:55 Envoy: PM Hasina-Xi talks exemplify strong ties between developing nations
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/323493/envoy-pm-hasina-xi-talks-exemplify-strong-ties 3/8“The future of Bangladesh shall be determined by the Bangladeshi people,” said the ambassador
adding “China is full of confidence for the better future of Bangladesh as well as China-
Bangladesh relations.”
For the time being, over 600 Chinese enterprises are functioning in Bangladesh, and 10,000
Chinese citizens are living and working here.
According to Ambassador Yao, Chinese companies proactively undertake social responsibilities
on boosting local economy, protecting the environment, providing social services to host
communities, help create job opportunities, build capacity for manpower and promote charity.
“With their contribution and efforts, the hearts of the two peoples are brought together ever
closer,” he said.
When asked whether he is concerned about the interests of Chinese companies and citizens in the
context of heated political air, Yao replied that the Chinese people are here for friendship and
joint development with Bangladeshi people. “Their safety and security should surely be
guaranteed, and their lawful interests should be protected,” he opined.
Priorities Ahead
Bangladesh and China will celebrate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties in 2025. “It would be
a perfect occasion to review achievements in the past and map forward for the future,” the
ambassador said.
He promised that China would do its part to help Bangladesh to graduate from the LDCs by
2026, and fuel up joint development to achieve respective national dreams which are “well-
connected”.
“Practical cooperation is the cornerstone of China-Bangladesh relations. While implementing
projects agreed during high-level visits back in 2016 and 2019, we will take the initiative with
Bangladesh to figure out more under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Global
Development Initiative (GDI) on connectivity infrastructure, renewable power section, blue
economy, digital empowerment, so on and so forth,” said the Chinese envoy.
In terms of trade, he said, local exporters are encouraged to fully leverage China’s 98% zero-tariff
treatment for Bangladeshi products and showcase the brand of “Made in Bangladesh” on
expositions held in China, such as China International Import Expo, China-South Asia Expo and
Canton Fair.25/05/2025, 14:55 Envoy: PM Hasina-Xi talks exemplify strong ties between developing nations
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/323493/envoy-pm-hasina-xi-talks-exemplify-strong-ties 4/8The Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone in Chittagong should eye on high-end and high-value
industries to serve the Smart Bangladesh development strategy as well as the high-quality
development paradigm of China, he said.
“We would encourage Chinese entrepreneurs to increase investment in promising fields like new
energy, ICT, advanced manufacturing, and agri-product processing,” Ambassador Yao said,
adding that he would also push forward the cooperation on disaster management and relief,
military exchanges, law enforcement coordination and maritime cooperation during his tenure in
Dhaka.
“Of course, as the Chinese ambassador, I’d play my role in mediating between Bangladesh and
Myanmar to facilitate the early and sustainable repatriation of displaced people from Rakhine
State,” he underscored.
BRI Pr oject
“The Belt and Road Initiative has brought about tangible benefit for the Bangladeshi people,”
Ambassador Yao said, “Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina described BRI a ‘trailblazer’ for
Bangladesh’s development.”
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the launching of BRI and the 7th anniversary of
Bangladesh’s participation in the initiative.
“In recent years, we have witnessed completion of a good number of projects built under the BRI
that have significantly changed the development landscape of Bangladesh, such as the Info-
Sarker phase 3 project, the Bangabandhu Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center, the
Payra Thermal Power Plant, the Dasherkandi Sewage Treatment Plant, among others,” he said.
“Connectivity will be further improved between the Southwestern part and the rest of the country
when the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel under the Karnaphuli river and the First
Section of the Padma Bridge Railway Link open for traffic by the end of this year,” he noted.
Asked about the latest status of ongoing development projects, he said that projects like the
Modernization of the Telecommunication Network for Digital Connectivity and the Installation of
Single Point Mooring with Double Pipeline Project will be completed soon.
“The Rajshahi WASA Surface Water Treatment Plant will start its construction, and the Teesta
River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project is also under discussion between
authorities of the two sides,” he added.25/05/2025, 14:55 Envoy: PM Hasina-Xi talks exemplify strong ties between developing nations
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/323493/envoy-pm-hasina-xi-talks-exemplify-strong-ties 5/8Global development initiative
The Global Development Initiative (GDI), a twin sister of BRI, is said to be aimed at supporting
the timely achievement of all 17 Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by
revitalizing global development partnerships and promoting stronger, greener and healthier global
development.
Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward GDI at the United Nations in 2021. It promotes
international cooperation in eight priority areas, namely poverty alleviation, food security,
pandemic response and vaccines, financing for development, climate change and green
development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity in the digital era.
“All these are also the focus of Bangladesh in its Vision 2041 perspective plan,” said the
ambassador.
According to the United Nations, over 100 countries and international organizations have
expressed their support to the initiative and 68 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the
GDI at the UN.
This July, the first high-level meeting of the Global Action Forum for Shared Development was
held in Beijing, with more than 800 guests from 158 countries and international organizations
attending online and offline. Minister of Planning MA Mannan took part in the event on behalf of
Bangladesh.
“It is hoped that Bangladesh would make good use of China’s aid, preferential loans and the
Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund to actively carry out policy dialogue,
experience sharing, capacity building and practical cooperation,” said the ambassador.
Producing gr een energy
Responding to a question, the envoy said China, a key contributor to the Paris Agreement,
pledged to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and to reach carbon neutrality by 2060.
“By 2035, China will broadly establish eco-friendly ways of work and life, lower carbon
emissions after reaching a peak, improve the environment and largely accomplish the goal of
building a ‘Beautiful China’,” he added.
Bangladesh also faces critical challenges of environmental degradation and climate change.25/05/2025, 14:55 Envoy: PM Hasina-Xi talks exemplify strong ties between developing nations
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/323493/envoy-pm-hasina-xi-talks-exemplify-strong-ties 6/8“Fortunately, the country has become well aware of the gravity of these issues, and has taken
plausible actions,” the Chinese envoy said, noting that the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan
(MCPP) adopted in 2020 plays a key role in guiding the country’s development paradigm into the
track of green transition by 2030.
“As Bangladesh and China converge on environmental goals, there heralds significant potentials
for the two countries to synergize on green development strategies, thereby building a shared
human community in harmony with nature,” said Ambassador Yao.
“In fact, we have already kicked start cooperation in this regard. When I visited Cox’s Bazar a
few months ago, I saw photovoltaic panels of Chinese brand on top of many roofs. A wind farm
project is also being built there by Chinese contractors,” he added.
Next generation of gr een traffic
It was reported that Bangladesh had its first electric vehicle (EV) charging station installed in
Dhaka earlier this month.
“I read it from a newspaper. But there are only 35 EV registered in Bangladesh for the time being.
That is a negligible amount compared to the 170 million population of Bangladesh,” he said.
China is a key designer and manufacturer of EV. There are over 16 million EV and mixed-fuel
vehicles running on the road of China, and the number is still soaring up.
“We would encourage more Chinese EV manufacturers to come to Bangladesh, explore the local
market, and meet the demand of Bangladeshi people, thereby helping Bangladesh transit towards
the next generation of green traffic,” said the ambassador.
People-to-people exchanges
In the interview, Ambassador Yao said people-to-people exchanges lay the foundation for
Bangladesh-China friendship.
Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a touching letter to Alifa Chin, a
Bangladeshi teenager born with the help of the Chinese navy hospital ship “Peace Ark” and
named after China by her father. 
Expressing his hope that Chin would make the best use of her youthful years and study hard to
make her dream come true, President Xi encouraged her to give back to her family, contribute to
society, and serve her own country.25/05/2025, 14:55 Envoy: PM Hasina-Xi talks exemplify strong ties between developing nations
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/323493/envoy-pm-hasina-xi-talks-exemplify-strong-ties 7/8“President Xi Jinping’s reply letter to Alifa Chin ushers in a new chapter for the intimate relations
between the two peoples. From this start, we’d further enhance people-to-people exchanges
between us,” said the ambassador.
As of now, there are more than 12,000 Bangladeshi students studying in China. Three Confucius
Institutes and classrooms are functioning in Bangladesh. The Chinese envoy sees them as “seed
and hope” for enhanced mutual understandings.
“The local media also play a unique role in influencing public opinion and bridging recognition
gaps. It is my sincere hope that prominent media houses like UNB would keep producing
objective and fair reports about China and China-Bangladesh cooperation, thereby contribute to
the betterment of friendly ties between our two countries and peoples,” he said.

Bangladesh and China seem poised to join forces in a new Beijing-sponsored forum styled
Global Development Initiative (GDI) with a massive development programme.
Sources have said the Chinese government sent Bangladesh the final draft of the
memorandum of understanding or MoU on the GDI seeking feedback and confirmation, andBN
25/05/2025, 11:16 Bangladesh vetting deal on joining GDI amid world reordering | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bangladesh-vetting-deal-on-joining-gdi-amid-world-reordering 1/7the vetting of its nitty-gritty is in progress.
According to highly placed sources, the draft incorporates some of the comments
forwarded by Bangladesh side earlier.
In lockstep with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is coming up GDI as the latest flagship
development recipe conceived by Chinese President Xi Jinping under which China intends
to support development aspirations of other countries.
Emerging in the wake of current context of what is dubbed reordering of world order from
bipolar through unipolar to multipolar, the forumʼs draft MoU proposes to take China-
Bangladesh strategic cooperative partnership to new highs.
Also envisaged is making full use of Chinese grants, interest- free loans, concessional loans,
and global development and South-South Cooperation Fund, and building regional
flagship projects.
Commenting on the developments a senior official at the finance ministry, who is involved
with the negotiations, told the FE that the government is scrutinising the text of the MoU.
“We have joined the Belt and Road Initiative, so there is no problem in joining the GDI,” he
said, pointing out that implementation of the agreement might take a long time.
International relations analyst Ambassador Humayun Kabir says itʼs logical that, as a
partner of the BRI, Bangladesh will join the GDI.
“But the authorities should be aware of keeping its national interest first in the negotiations
as it had done during the BRI,” he notes.
He also feels that as Bangladesh has shown its willingness to work with all the global
players by simultaneously supporting the US-led Indo-Pacific Strategy and by joining the
China-led BRI and the GDI.
As proposed, the Chinese GDI projects will be implemented through the China international
Development Cooperation Agency, the development arm of the Chinese government.
The proposed MoU entitled ʻStrengthening development cooperation and promotion of
implementation of the global development Initiativeʼ says global development has come to
a critical juncture and developing countries are facing serious challenges in achieving the
UN-designated 2030 Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs.25/05/2025, 11:16 Bangladesh vetting deal on joining GDI amid world reordering | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bangladesh-vetting-deal-on-joining-gdi-amid-world-reordering 2/7“The global development initiative GDI proposed by President Xi Jinping has entered a new
phase of practical cooperation. China and Bangladesh are ready to enhance strategic
alignment, expand development cooperation under the framework of the Global
Development Initiative and take China-Bangladesh strategic cooperative partnership
featuring sincere mutual assistance and lasting friendship to a new level,” the daft deal
reads.
The memorandum proposes active expansion of development cooperation under the
framework of the GDI.
As proposed in the MoU, the two sides will agree to strengthen communication and
coordination jointly implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state,
push for implementation of outcomes in development cooperation, and carry out more
projects to promote economic development and improve peopleʼs livelihood in Bangladesh
so as to deliver tangible benefits to the people of both countries.
It focuses eight priority areas, namely, healthcare, disaster prevention and relief,
connectivity, climate change and green development, digital economy, poverty reduction,
education and active engagement in public in policy dialogue, experience sharing, capacity
building, and practical cooperation.
China is willing to provide support within its capability to facilitate the implementation of
cooperation projects in the eight areas based on the needs of Bangladesh and explore other
potential projects in line with the GDI.
It also aims to establish a consultation mechanism at the director-general or equivalent
level and hold regular online or off-line meetings to gently promote coordinated actions in
development cooperation and identify and address problems in a timely manner so as to
facilitate efficient implementation of projects.
About the tenure of the MoU, the proposal says it shall enter into force upon signature and
remain valid for two years.
But unless either party informs the other in writing for the termination within six months
before the expiry date, this memorandum shall be extended automatically for another two
years, the proposal says, adding that the rule shall prevail for any extension thereafter.
According to the draft, in case of termination the ongoing projects under the memorandum
shall not be affected and shall be continued as per the signed financial agreement for each
individual project.25/05/2025, 11:16 Bangladesh vetting deal on joining GDI amid world reordering | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bangladesh-vetting-deal-on-joining-gdi-amid-world-reordering 3/7Bangladesh and China started talks on GDI participation last year and gained momentum
after the visit of the then Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yiʼs visit to Dhaka in August 2022,
foreign ministry officials said.
Last week, Chinese envoy in Dhaka Yao Wen said China is willing to work with Bangladesh
to continue exploring cooperation opportunities under the GDI.
The Global Development Initiative, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the General
Debate of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2021, aims to steer
global development toward a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth,
said Chinese officials.
They said the GDI is another major initiative put forward by China after the Belt and Road
Initiative and it is a ʻremobilizationʼ of world development cooperation and a ʻreaffirmationʼ
of the people-oriented concept.
According to Chinese media, since its inception one year ago, the GDI has received warm
responses from the international community, with more than 100 countries having
extended their support to date.

Bangladesh is expected to export the two fruits to China in a big way in the
coming months,"" said Shafiqul Alam in his post.
They discussed ways to further strengthen the relations between the two
countries and take it to a new height protecting Dhaka-Beijing's mutual and
strategic interests, reports UNB.

China, trade and investment growth, agriculture, infrastructure, support for
renewable energy sectors, and resolving the Rohingya issue, as well as overall
issues of mutual interest between the two countries, eyeing a new chapter in
relations.
At the meeting, Prof Yunus sought China's greater role in establishing peace,
prosperity and stability for both nations.

International Trade (CCPIT), a semi-governmental organisation that promotes
China's trade and economic relations with other countries, met Chief Adviser Prof

https://bdnews24.com/economy/g7-aims-to-raise-600-billion-to-counter-china-s-belt-and-road 2/9Biden said the United States would mobilise $200 billion in grants, federal funds and private investment
over five years to support projects in low- and middle-income countries that help tackle climate change as
well as improve global health, gender equity and digital infrastructure.
""I want to be clear . This isn't aid or charity . It's an investment that will deliver returns for everyone,"" Biden
said, adding that it would allow countries to ""see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies.""
Biden said hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks,
development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others.
Europe will mobilise 300 billion euros for the initiative over the same period to build up a sustainable
alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in
2013, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering.
The leaders of Italy , Canada and Japan also spoke about their plans, some of which have already been
announced separately . French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were
not present, but their countries are also participating.25/05/2025, 11:23 G7 aims to raise $600 billion to counter China's Belt and Road

modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route from Asia to Europe.
White House of ficials said the plan has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries.
Biden highlighted several flagship projects, including a $2 billion solar development project in Angola with
support from the Commerce Department, the US Export-Import Bank, US firm AfricaGlobal Schaf fer, and
US project developer Sun Africa.
Together with G7 members and the EU, W ashington will also provide $3.3 million in technical assistance to
Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing
facility in that country that can eventually produce COVID-19 and other vaccines, a project that also
involves the EU.
The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will also commit up to $50 million over five years to
the W orld Bank’ s global Childcare Incentive Fund.
Friederike Roder , vice president of the non-profit group Global Citizen, said the pledges of investment could
be ""a good start"" toward greater engagement by G7 countries in developing nations and could underpin
stronger global growth for all.25/05/2025, 11:23 G7 aims to raise $600 billion to counter China's Belt and Road

BRI Summit: China welcomes leaders of
130 countries
Tue Oct 17, 2023 12:00 AM
Last update on: Tue Oct 17, 2023 12:30 PM
The most senior EU leader expected to attend the third Belt and Road (BRI)
Summit this week is Hungary's populist Viktor Orban, who will join guests
including Russia's Vladimir Putin and a minister of the Afghan Taliban.
Western scepticism of the cornerstone of President Xi Jinping's ambition to
extend China's global influence stems from China's failure to assuage concern
over its intentions, and whether there is in fact a gap this infrastructure would be
filling, compounded by concern over a lack of transparency, analysts say.
Such Western doubts have coincided with Xi's assertive leadership and a
deterioration in ties over trade, human rights, Covid-19, and Taiwan. Italy, the
only Group of 7 nation to sign on to the scheme, is now looking for a way out.
Xi is pushing to make the BRI smaller and greener, and to move from big-ticket
projects like dams to high-tech ones such as digital finance and e-commerce
platforms. The aim is to aid a broader push for a world order that is multipolar
and gives the global south more agency, rather than one dominated by
Washington and its allies, analysts say.
China has at times bristled at criticism of the BRI, saying it carries anti-Chinese
prejudice and a wish to contain its rise, while overlooking what it says are
genuine good intentions.
China says more than 130 countries will attend this week, notably from Latin
America and Africa, although, unlike in previous years, many more are sending
ministers rather than heads of state.
Yesterday, a hotel in downtown Beijing hosting delegations from Russia,
Kazakhstan and Congo was buzzing with activity, its lobby decorated with
displays of BRI goods and guarded by metal detectors at entrances.
More than USD 90 billion worth of Chinese commercial investment in BRI
projects has faced ""insurmountable problems"", according to data from the
American Enterprise Institute think tank. The issues range from outright
cancellation to indefinite delays, ""mainly from political requirements and errors
by Chinese firms"".
""From the Chinese perspective, the biggest problem is that they've realised now
that they're carrying an awful lot of debt in developing countries which are going
to struggle to really pay it back,"" said Raffaello Pantucci from the S.Rajaratnam
School of International Studies in Singapore.
This is one reason the initiative has shrunk and is focused more on quality than
quantity, say analysts. But the BRI is also more focused on issues like peace,
climate change, energy crises and artificial intelligence, among many other areas,
according to a Chinese government white paper released last week.
Ruby Osman, a China expert at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, said
the summit would give China a chance to showcase some of the global initiatives
that Xi has launched over the past two years.
In particular, she pointed to the Global Development Initiative, a USD10 billion
programme started in 2021 to promote ""social and economic development"",
similar schemes focused on security and ""civilization"".
""These sort of mutually reinforcing initiatives are a way for, in Beijing's eyes, to
share Chinese governance ideals, to build consensus on Chinese norms and to
start exporting elements of China's development model,"" Osman said.
The change in the BRI focus is apparent in China's offer of assistance in recent
months to Argentina, through doubling the amount it can access through a
currency swap line to nearly USD10 billion in a boost to its dwindling foreign
currency reserves, and enabling it to pay back International Monetary Fund debt
and purchase imports.
And last week, Beijing agreed to restructure loans owed by Sri Lanka and Zambia,
in what appeared to be its latest demonstration of goodwill towards developing
countries.
Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization think tank,
said the BRI had ""greatly pushed forward global awareness about the
infrastructure deficit"".
""It's not perfect, but it's a process, and people are gradually realising it's so
important: we need to build infrastructure. And I think the importance of that is
being realised,"" Wang said.",0.090196078,0.288235294,,Positive

In Monday’s section, Ambassador Li discusses the alignment of China’s Belt and Road Initiative
with Bangladesh’s Vision 2041 and the role China plays in Bangladesh’s development
How will China str engthen the alignment of its Belt
and Road Initiative with Bangladesh’ s Vision 2041 in
near  futur e? How many development pr ojects in
Bangladesh ar e funded by China? What ar e the key
projects?
Bangladesh’s Vision 2041 perspective plan provides road-map for accelerating growth and lays
down broad approaches for eradication of poverty, inequality, and human deprivation. By
implementing the plan, Bangladesh is expected to make rapid change in agriculture, trade and
industry, education, health care, transportation and communication, etc.
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the right venue for tangible and intangible outcomes pertinent to
innovative, harmonized, green, open, high-quality and shared developments, which protects and
maintains peace and promotes people's well-being in the post COVID-19 era. 
BRI is proposed by China, but not owned exclusively by China. Ever since its genesis, BRI has
been aiming at integrating with development strategies of all parties interested. Bangladesh is one
of the first countries to respond to BRI and an important participant thereof. By far, Bangladesh
has become one of the countries with most cooperation and fruitful results under the BRI
framework.
Also Read: ‘Belt and Road Initiative and Vision 2041 to integrate further’
As strategic partners of cooperation, it is natural for Bangladesh and China to coordinate and
integrate development strategies. We have established the Joint Economic and Trade Committee
as an institutional arrangement for economic and trade cooperation. 
x25/05/2025, 14:46 ‘By far, Bangladesh has become one of the countries with most cooperation and fruitful results under the BRI framework’
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/293097/‘by-far-bangladesh-has-become-one-of-the 2/4According to data from China, the bilateral trade between China and Bangladesh increased
significantly in 2021, exceeding 25 billion US dollars. The turnover of China's contracted
projects to Bangladesh remained in the forefront of South Asian countries, and China's
investment in Bangladesh increased by more than 290% year-on-year.
To further enhance integration of development strategies, the two sides could work together in the
following aspects:
First, we need to further strengthen political mutual trust, consolidate the foundation for win-win
results, enhance risk management and control, and secure the cooperation environment against
the rapidly changing international situation.
Second, we need to further enhance inter-governmental cooperation and promote the
implementation of major projects. After Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Bangladesh in
2016, a series of major projects have been progressing smoothly and are expected to be
completed by the end of 2024. 
Third, we need to fully utilize the high-quality projects and expand the volume of cooperation,
such as the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center, the zero-tariff treatment for 98% of
Bangladeshi products exported to China, and the large-scale international exhibitions like the
China International Import Expo and the Canton Fair.
Fourth, we need to explore new opportunities and cultivate new growth points. Specifically, we
can promote PPP cooperation, advance studies on bilateral FTA, jointly respond to pandemic and
climate change, restore rivers, develop green and low-carbon energies, and work on digital
economy.

Kazi Anis Ahmed, PublisherIn recent years, China has achieved leapfrog development in renewable energy. The installed
scale of hydropower, wind power, photovoltaic power and biomass power has been the world's
largest for 17 years, 12 years, 7 years, and 4 years respectively. 
China and Bangladesh have broad scope for cooperation and development in the field of
renewable energy. Against the backdrop of the global response to climate change and accelerated
energy transition, it is necessary for China and Bangladesh to strengthen cooperation on global
energy governance, promote healthy development of global energy governance system, and make
positive contributions to the response to climate change.

(BIDA) Kazi M Aminul Islam said, the $3.6 billion FDI in 2018 was 68 percent more than the previous year .
“This is a record,” he said, “If the trend continues, we hope the FDI figures will touch double digits in 2021”.
Bangladesh is traditionally a low FDI-attracting country . The FDI was less than 100 million even in 1996
when the ruling Awami League first came to power .
“It became more than half a billion in its five years,” the BIDA  chairman, Islam, said.
“Then again it fell. It hit the $1 billion mark for the first time in 2008, following investment in the telecom
sector . The FDI crossed that figure again in 201 1 under the Awami Legaue government and has gradually
increased ever since.”

previous year while intra-company loans increased by four times.
Describing the significance of the development, the executive chairman said, “It means confidence, it
means they (foreign investors) are very comfortable about investing here now more than before.”
In 2018, Bangladesh was the recipient of a dif ferent type of investment in the form of mergers and
acquisitions, he added. But the figures did not account for the investment made by Japan Tobacco.
“If we add that $1.4 billion, then FDI figure will go up to $5 billion”.
BIDA  MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
The BIDA  executive chairman credits the FDI growth to economic stability , political stability , controlling
inflation along with a young and talented workforce.
“It’s very clear to foreign investors that the Bangladeshi economy is expanding from within while integrating
with the rest of the world at the same time.”
“BIDA  had a big role in this,” he said, referring to the creation of BIDA  two years ago through the merger of
the Board of Investment and Privatisation Commission.Ad25/05/2025, 10:59 Bangladesh receives record FDI in 2018, China tops investors’ list

Tk193 billion. But since its inception,  the figure has soared to Tk 945 billion per year .
He said that the investment body is implementing the One Stop Service (OSS) Act. “W e have already
started online OSS for BIDA  and registered joint stock company services. Fifteen BIDA  services were
already of fered online through the OSS and we are starting another seven services. So we are making 22
services available under the OSS.”
“As a result, we are seeing an upward trend and in future, it will rise further ,” he said.
Chinese investment totalled $1.03 billion in 2018 with the bulk of it - $834 million - coming in the power
sector .  In 2017, China invested only $1 19 million in the country .
But US investments only saw a marginal increase, rising to $174 million from $166 million in 2017.
Islam attributes this to the US administration’ s policy of massive tax cuts for internal investments. The US’ s
investment has declined globally as a result.
On the contrary , China is investing in the region under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which Bangladesh
joined in 2016 during President Xi Jinping’ s visit.
The major overall investments in 2018 came in the power sector followed by food, agriculture and fishing,
textile and garment, banking, telecom and gas and petroleum sectors.
“We are presenting Bangladesh’ s possibilities in a focused way . We have targeted some specific countries
such as Japan, Germany , India, UK and US for future investment. W e have targeted some big companiesAd

_China-Bangladesh relations have become the model of friendship between countries with different social systems and different cultures_ _ The Daily Star (4).pdf,"Exclusive Interview
'China-Bangladesh relations have
become the model of friendship between
countries with different social systems
and different cultures'
Thu Jul 19, 2012 12:00 AM
Last update on: Thu Jul 19, 2012 12:00 AM
His Excellency Li Jun
China's new ambassador to Bangladesh, Li Jun, arrived in Dhaka on February
18 and presented his credentials to the President on March 6. In an exclusive
interview with The Daily Star's Diplomatic Correspondent Rezaul Karim
recently, he talked on a wide range of bilateral issues. He said he would try his
best and cooperate with the government and people of Bangladesh to improve
further the ties between the two countries. He also said China and Bangladesh
are good neighbours. Since 1975, the bilateral relationship has always been
developing in a smooth manner an d bilateral cooperation in various areas has
been deepened. Following are excerpts from the interview.
The Daily Star (TDS): As the new Chinese Ambassador in Bangladesh, what are
the priorities you plan to emphasise during your assignment in this country?
Li Jun (L J): In March and June 2010, H.E. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of
Bangladesh, and H.E. Xi Jinping, Vice President of China, had a successful
exchange of visits. The two sides issued a Joint Statement and decided to establish
and develop a ""Closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation"" between China
and Bangladesh from the strategic perspective and on the basis of the principles
of longstanding friendship, equality and mutual benefit. I believe this set the
direction of and provided the guidelines for the development of our bilateral
relationship.
During my tenure,
* I will do my utmost to consolidate and develop the bilateral relationship with
the aim of promoting the development of our two countries and the welfare of
our two peoples;
* I will continue to push for more exchanges of high-level visits and contacts and
friendly exchanges between government agencies, parliaments, political parties,
and non-governmental organisations of our two countries;
* I will continue to push for intensified cooperation in trade, investment,
agriculture, transportation and infrastructure development on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit;
* I will continue to push for a further widening of people-to-people and cultural
exchanges and cooperation with a view to promoting mutual understanding and
friendship between the two peoples;
* I will continue to push for strengthened exchanges and cooperation between
the militaries and law enforcement departments to safeguard respective national
security and stability and promote peace and stability in the region;
* I will continue to push for closer coordination and cooperation to uphold the
common interests of the two countries as well as that of the developing countries
in international and regional affairs, such as climate change, energy and food
security.
I am confident that with the joint efforts of our two countries, the closer
comprehensive partnership of cooperation between China and Bangladesh will
be brought to a new high and bring tangible benefits for our two peoples.
TDS: Bangladesh and China enjoy excellent bilateral relations. How do you
foresee these relations developing further in the days ahead?
L J: The traditional friendship between our two peoples date back to over two
thousand years ago. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1975,
China-Bangladesh ties have been developing in a smooth manner and the
pragmatic cooperation in various fields has been further strengthened. It was the
efforts that successive governments and the peoples of our two countries have
made that contributed to the enhancement of China-Bangladesh friendship. To
them I pay my tributes.
Currently, the development of relations between China and Bangladesh enjoys the
right time, right place, and right people. China is implementing the 12th Five Year
Plan with scientific development as guidance and transforming economic growth
pattern as the main objective. At the same time, Bangladesh is pushing forward
the ""Digital Bangladesh"" and ""Vision 2012."" Our development strategies have
provided us great scope for cooperation. China and Bangladesh are close
neighbours, the region where we are situated has been experiencing rapid
growth, which created more opportunities for regional and international
cooperation. Apart from that, our bilateral relationship has neither problems left
from history, nor conflicts of interest at present. Compassion, understanding,
support, and mutual-assistance have always been the main theme of our
relationship.
I am convinced that the traditional friendship between China Bangladesh and
mutually beneficial cooperation will better contribute to the development of the
two countries and benefit the two peoples.
TDS: What are the major follow-up events after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
visit to China in March 2010?
L J: In March and June 2010, H.E. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh
and H.E. Xi Jinping, Vice President of China had an exchange of visits to each
other's countries. The two sides decided to establish a ""Closer Comprehensive
Partnership of Cooperation"" from the strategic perspective and on the basis of the
principles of longstanding friendship, equality, and mutual benefit. A Joint
Statement was also issued which reflected the consensus reached by leaders of
both countries to further consolidate and develop China-Bangladesh relationship.
Since then, there have been positive developments in bilateral relationship. There
have been constant exchanges of high-level visits between the two countries. The
Speaker of Bangladesh Parliament Abdul Hamid and Foreign Minister Dipu Moni,
as well as many ministers, have visited China. Liu Qi, Member of Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China (CPC) and Secretary of
CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, Qin Guangrong, Governor of Yunnan Province
of China as well as other high level officials visited Bangladesh.
There has been much progress in bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
Bilateral trade volume in 2011 reached $8.26 billion, with an increase of 17%
compared with 2010. Bangladeshi export to China reached $449 million, an
increase of 67.5%. According to local news reports, Chinese investment in
Bangladesh in 2011 amounted to over $200 million. The agreements on
introduction of 3G technology and expansion of 2.5G network, and on Shajhalal
fertilizer factory project were signed. The construction work will start very soon.
China also exempted debts of Bangladesh worth more than 600 million RMB.
There also have been positive developments in bilateral cultural exchanges. In
November 2011, Beijing Night Art Performance and Charming Beijing Photo
Exhibition were successfully held in Dhaka. Fantastic performances of the
Chinese artists and beautiful pictures of Beijing deepened Bangladeshi people's
understanding towards China. ""Happy Chinese New Year"" cultural events have
become a fam ous Chinese cultural brand in Bangladesh. Every year, Dhaka
citizens flock to the theater to enjoy the exciting moments of traditional Chinese
New Year.
In addition, there has been big progress also in other areas such as agriculture,
education, military, etc. I will continue to push forward the all-dimensional
cooperation in various fields between our two countries.
TDS: During the PM's visit to Beijing, Bangladesh and China agreed to
strengthen cooperation in the military and law enforcement areas at various
levels. Is there any progress in those fiends?
L J: Military cooperation is an important part of the all-dimensional cooperation
between China and Bangladesh. In the Joint Statement issued during Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to China in March 2010, the two sides agreed to
strengthen exchanges and cooperation between the militaries and law
enforcement departments to safeguard respective national security and stability
and promote peace and stability in the region. Military cooperation between
China and Bangladesh strictly adheres to relevant international law and norms on
international relations, and is not against any third party. In 2011, there was
successful cooperation between the two countries in this regard. Air Chief
Marshal Ma Xiaotian, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of People's Liberation
Army and Vice Admiral Ding Yiping, Deputy Commander of Navy of People's
Liberation Army visited Bangladesh with big success. General Mubin, Chief of
Army Staff of Bangladesh paid a visit to China, which was fruitful. I believe this
tendency of friendly cooperation will be maintained and further developed.
TDS: How do you evaluate China-Bangladesh relations under the present
Awami League-led grand alliance government in comparison to ties under
previous governments?
L J: The friendship between China and Bangladesh is a genuine and time-tested
one. No matter which party is in power, this bilateral relationship maintains the
tendency of moving forward. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in
1975, successive governments of Bangladesh have been making important
contributions to the development of the bilateral relationship. China-Bangladesh
relations have become the model of friendship between countries with different
social systems and different cultures.
During the tenure of current government under the leadership of H.E. Sheikh
Hasina, China-Bangladesh relations have witnessed considerable development,
and the all-dimensional cooperation between the two countries has been
continuously strengthened. Presently, China-Bangladesh relations are standing at
a new starting point, facing unprecedented historic opportunities. The Chinese
side stands ready to closely work with the Bangladesh side to further enrich the
closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation, strengthen the existing
bilateral cooperation in different fields, and enhance the friendship between the
two peoples.
TDS: Strategically, how does China see Bangladesh in the geo-political equation
in the region?
L J: China adheres to the foreign policy of ""building friendship and partnership
with the neighboring countries,"" and would like to establish and maintain good-
neighbourly relations with all its neighbouring countries. China attaches
importance to the important role of Bangladesh in maintaining peace, stability
and development of South Asia. China is willing to join hands with Bangladesh
and further promote the closer Comprehensive Cooperative Partnership between
the two countries.
TDS: The cabinet recently approved the draft of Sonadia Deep Seaport
Authority Act. Is there any development from the Chinese side about
construction of the deep seaport at Sonadia in Chittagong?
L J: The deep seaport in Sonadia Island is of strategic importance to Bangladesh
and will be helpful in enabling Bangladesh to become the regional transportation
and logistics centre. Chinese enterprises have advanced technologies,
equipments and ample funds. Over the years, China Harbour Engineering
Company Ltd has accumulated rich experience in this regard. Presently, this
company has established an office in Dhaka and stands ready to participate in
this project in a commercial manner. Chinese enterprises are also ready to
cooperate with enterprises from other countries to jointly take part in this
project. So long as the Bangladeshi side shows enough will and determination,
this project can make positive progress very soon.
TDS: How can China cooperate with Bangladesh in tackling the impact of
climate change in Bangladesh?
L J: As a country most vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh has been
experiencing sufferings caused by climate change. China fully understands and
respects the concerns of Bangladesh over it. During international negotiations on
climate change, China has always been supporting the legitimate and reasonable
requests of Bangladesh and the Least Developed Countries as a whole. As
developing countries, China and Bangladesh should stick to the principle of
""common but differentiated responsibilities"" and work together to safeguard the
common interests of developing countries.
China and Bangladesh are both victims of climate change. On this issue, the two
countries face the same challenges and our basic interests are the same. Over the
years, China has already carried out cooperation with Bangladesh in the area of
adaptation. For example, China helped Bangladesh in projects of river dredging.
The Chinese Government provided relevant training for Bangladeshi officials and
technicians. China will continue to strengthen the cooperation with Bangladesh
in this regard on the basis of ""equal consultation, mutual benefit and common
development"". China will continue to support the capacity building to help
Bangladesh better resist the adverse effects of climate change. Relevant
government institutions of the two countries can have detailed discussions.
TDS: Is there any progress in the construction of the 8th Friendship Bridge (2nd
Meghna Bridge) and Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Centre?
L J: Consultations are going on between our two countries concerning the 8th
Friendship Bridge. I believe there will be a positive result soon. As for the China-
Bangladesh Friendship Exhibition Centre, we noticed some news reports saying
that the Bangladeshi government has decided to build this Centre at Purbachal.
We would be very happy to get the confirmation from and work with the
Bangladeshi side so that concrete progress can be made concerning this project.
TDS: Would you be willing to provide assistance to Bangladesh in launching a
communication and remote sensing satellite into orbit in the near future?
L J: China is willing to provide assistance to Bangladesh in launching a satellite.
This has been reflected in the Joint Statement issued by the two countries during
the visit of Her Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to China in March
2010. The two sides can have further consultations in this regard.
TDS: Will you provide assistance for the dredging of riverbeds and for capacity
building through training of personnel?
L J: Bangladesh is a country with a large number of rivers. River dredging is
essential to the livelihood of Bangladesh people and the development of this
country. Against the backdrop of global climate change, river dredging becomes
even more important. China understands the need of Bangladesh and always tries
to extend its help. Each year, the Chinese government provides relevant training
courses for Bangladeshi government official and technicians. Besides, the
Chinese government strongly supports qualified Chinese enterprises to take part
in dredging projects. In September 2011, China Harbour Engineering Company
Ltd was selected to implement a project for Jamuna River dredging (14
kilometers). China will continue to provide its support at the request of
Bangladeshi government.",0.143263289,0.387477861,,Positive

How Bangladesh quietly balances its diplomatic strategy amid great power rivalries
Fazlul Halim Rana
Update : 23 Ma y 2025, 10:00 AM
With Beijing extending its strategic and economic reach through expansive initiatives, Dhaka
faces the dual challenge of benefiting from such engagement while avoiding entanglement in
broader rivalries.

x25/05/2025, 15:06 Between the dragon and the deep sea
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/382005/between-the-dragon-and-the-deep-sea 1/6Rather than gravitating toward any single power bloc, Bangladesh has cultivated a posture of
strategic moderation. This balancing act -- deliberate and calculated underscores a desire to
maintain autonomy while drawing economic dividends from all major players. Its diplomacy
reflects an adaptive, interest-driven strategy grounded in development needs and regional
sensitivities.
The arc of Chinese influence in South Asia
China’s growing regional footprint has been marked by ambitious connectivity plans, military
cooperation, and direct investment under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Across South Asia,
Beijing has supported transformative infrastructure from the China-Pakistan economic corridor,
to transport hubs in Sri Lanka, and investments in the Maldives and Nepal.
Bangladesh has emerged as a key participant in this landscape. As of 2023, China stood as
Bangladesh’s largest trading partner, with annual trade surpassing $25 billion. Chinese exports,
including industrial machinery and electronics, far outpace imports from Bangladesh, primarily
composed of garments and leather goods. 
Beyond trade, China has directed substantial funds into energy, transport, and digital
infrastructure.
Notable projects such as the Payra thermal power station, the Karnaphuli river tunnel, and rail
expansion linked to the Padma Bridge showcase China's infrastructure footprint in Bangladesh.
These projects, typically financed by concessional Chinese loans or executed by state-owned
firms, have expanded Beijing’s institutional presence within Dhaka’s development sector.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/382005/between-the-dragon-and-the-deep-sea 2/6Strategic compulsions and economic calculations
China’s role in Bangladesh’s development stems not from ideological affinity but pragmatic
economic necessity. 
With an ambitious vision to become a developed nation by 2041, Bangladesh requires vast capital
for infrastructure modernization. China's financial and technical assistance delivered swiftly and
often with minimal political conditions makes it an attractive partner.
Yet policymakers in Dhaka are wary of overdependence. The financial crises experienced by
countries like Sri Lanka, where excessive debt to China has triggered concerns over sovereignty,
serve as cautionary tales.
Bangladesh has taken a more cautious route. According to the International Monetary Fund, the
country’s external debt remains manageable, with Chinese credit comprising only a fraction of
total obligations. Furthermore, Bangladesh has declined to sign a formal BRI agreement,
choosing instead to evaluate Chinese-funded projects on an individual basis -- an approach that
allows for flexibility and due diligence.
 
India, China, and the balancing equation
Relations with India continue to form a cornerstone of Bangladesh’s foreign policy. Shared
historical narratives, cultural ties, and geographic proximity anchor this relationship. However,
persistent bilateral issues, ranging from river water sharing to trade imbalances, periodically
create friction.
China, by contrast, leverages economic engagement to offer Bangladesh alternative avenues of
cooperation. 
India, concerned about China's increasing influence in its neighbourhood, has intensified its
outreach through development grants, infrastructure support, and defense initiatives. However,
delays in Indian project execution and bureaucratic bottlenecks often limit their competitiveness.
In response, Bangladesh has adopted a parallel engagement model. For instance, port
development projects see simultaneous interest from both Indian and Chinese entities ensuring
that Dhaka avoids exclusive commitments. This strategy, described in international relations
literature as “hedging,” allows Bangladesh to maintain strategic flexibility while maximizing
benefits from competing powers.x

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/382005/between-the-dragon-and-the-deep-sea 3/6
Dhaka’ s restrained, measured approach is not a sign of weakness but a
testament to diplomatic maturity
The US factor and the Indo-Pacific conundrum
The United States has revived its interest in South Asia through its Indo-Pacific strategy, which
emphasizes maritime security, democratic governance, and economic resilience. 
Given its coastal location along the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh features prominently in
Washington’s strategic calculus. The US remains Dhaka’s top export destination and is a critical
player in counterterrorism cooperation.
However, tensions have occasionally surfaced over issues like human rights, electoral
transparency, and labor standards. US sanctions and visa policies have at times complicated
bilateral relations, prompting Bangladesh to diversify its diplomatic outreach. 
China’s stance of non-interference in domestic politics contrasts with Western conditionality and
thus resonates with Dhaka’s emphasis on sovereignty.
Despite this, Bangladesh has not formally aligned with Beijing’s Global Development Initiative
(GDI) or Global Security Initiative (GSI). Similarly, it has expressed interest -- but not formal
commitment -- to the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). These choices reflect a
preference for multilateral engagement over strategic alignment.
Public opinion and policy discourse
Public sentiment in Bangladesh toward China is largely driven by tangible economic outcomes.
Surveys by Pew Research Centre and the Asia Foundation show that many Bangladeshis
appreciate Chinese investments for their role in infrastructure and industrial growth. 
At the same time, concerns about labour practices, environmental standards, and debt
sustainability temper this enthusiasm.
Academic circles and civil society in Bangladesh have also engaged critically with Chinese
projects. Environmental groups, for example, have raised alarms over the ecological impact of
coal-fired plants funded by Chinese entities. These pressures have led the government to re-
evaluate its energy portfolio, including a gradual shift toward renewables.x

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/382005/between-the-dragon-and-the-deep-sea 4/6Think tanks and policy analysts continue to debate the long-term implications of Chinese
involvement. Calls for transparency, local stakeholder inclusion, and rigorous feasibility studies
reflect growing awareness of the need to safeguard national interests in all external engagements.
A future of strategic equilibrium
Bangladesh’s engagement with China illustrates a foreign policy grounded in pragmatism rather
than partisanship. Its strategy is neither a pivot nor a passive accommodation, but a calibrated
stance shaped by national development goals, regional dynamics, and a historical commitment to
non-alignment.
Rather than succumbing to external pressure, Bangladesh is cultivating a space of autonomous
diplomacy engaging with all sides while maintaining a sovereign trajectory. Echoing Deng
Xiaoping’s advice to “hide brilliance and bide time,” Dhaka’s restrained, measured approach is
not a sign of weakness but a testament to diplomatic maturity.
By staying the course and maintaining balance, Bangladesh is not merely reacting to global shifts
it is actively shaping its role within them.

Taking China-Bangladesh relations to a
new height
Mon Apr 7, 2025 03:30 PM
Last update on: Mon Apr 7, 2025 09:04 PM
Professor Yunus, the chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh, has
just concluded his visit to China. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Bangladesh. Professor
Yunus's visit to China around this time, upon the invitation of the Chinese
government, shows the importance both sides place on bilateral relations.

-- the third day of his four-day visit to China. File Photo: PID
The relationship between China and Bangladesh is not directed towards third
parties. The series of high-level arrangements made by the Chinese side—like
President Xi meeting with Professor Yunus at the Great Hall of the People;
Professor Yunus being invited to speak at the Boao Forum for Asia; the meeting at
Boao between Yunus and Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang of the State Council; the
meeting between Yunus and Vice President Han Zheng in Beijing; and Yunus's
speech at Peking University and his honorary degree—not only reflect China's
respect for the man but also demonstrate respect and support for the interim
government of Bangladesh and the path independently chosen by its people.
China has always emphasised that its friendly policy towards Bangladesh is for all
Bangladeshis. It hopes that the policies and reforms conducted by the interim
government of Bangladesh will promote the stability, development, and
prosperity of Bangladesh.
The chief adviser's visit to China has significantly deepened the comprehensive
strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries. China expressed
hopes that Bangladesh's interim government will demonstrate the capability to
balance potential contradictions between managing major-power relations and
advancing domestic economic and social development.

Yunus’s China visit can open many doors
Yunus's visit prioritises economic cooperation, reflecting the urgent desire to
address domestic economic challenges. Bangladesh is one of the earliest
countries to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Over the past decade, Chinese
enterprises have made significant contributions to Bangladesh. The completion
of the Padma Bridge has reduced the travel time between the two sides from the
previous 7 to 8 hours to the current 11 minutes, and the Dasherkandi Sewage
Treatment Plant has become a tourist attraction for Dhaka citizens.
Professor Yunus's visit will significantly advance practical cooperation between
China and Bangladesh. As a nation of 170 million people, Bangladesh enjoys
promising development prospects that Chinese enterprises view with great
optimism. Many Chinese enterprises have relocated their South Asian
headquarters to Bangladesh. The two countries can collaborate to achieve their
respective modernisation goals. China hopes to continue promoting high-quality
Belt and Road cooperation with Bangladesh. As long as Bangladesh maintains
political and social stability, Chinese enterprises are expected to carry out further
industrial cooperation with Bangladesh based on commercial principles,
supporting Bangladesh in advancing its industrialisation process—especially by
investing in areas where China leads, such as textiles and clothing, clean energy,
the digital economy, agriculture, and manufacturing—creating jobs and export
profits for Bangladesh. At the same time, China is also expected to facilitate
market access for high-quality Bangladeshi fruits and aquatic products.

A diplomatic reset wrapped in contradiction
In 2026, Bangladesh will graduate from the list of least developed countries.
Yunus once proposed the ""Three Zeros Theory""—zero poverty, zero
unemployment, and zero carbon emissions—which has some commonalities with
President Xi's Global Development Initiative (GDI). China is now helping
countries in the Global South break through the ""low-level equilibrium trap""
through the GDI. By 2024, the GDI had mobilised tens of billions of dollars to
support more than 1,100 projects, covering areas such as health, education, and
the digital economy. Professor Yunus praised the vision of building a community
with a shared future and expressed appreciation for the GDI. He also recognised
the importance of the Global Civilisation Initiative proposed by President Xi. In
the future, China and Bangladesh can further strengthen the exchange of
governance experiences.

BRI: Risks and opportunities for
Bangladesh
Mon Sep 23, 2019 12:00 AM
Last update on: Mon Sep 23, 2019 12:00 AM
The belt and road initiative (BRI), initiated by Chinese president Xi Jinping in
2013, is expected to increase global connectivity through land and sea routes and
facilitate trade among the BRI signatory countries.
BRI has been widely accepted by many countries. The initiative to enhance
connectivity has been extended from Asia to Europe, Africa and Latin America.
So far, more than 120 countries have already joined the BRI and Bangladesh is one
of them. During the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Bangladesh in 2016,
he pledged USD 40 billion for building up infrastructure under the BRI and
signed an MOU in this regard. Many big projects are being built in Bangladesh
under this initiative.
China has vast resources which remain untapped. The country now needs to
boost trade with regional and global powers to emerge as an economic super
power. Moreover, this initiative enhances China’s influence as a soft power
international diplomacy.
The proponents of the BRI in Bangladesh are seeing this initiative as a window of
opportunities for Bangladesh. Other groups are apprehensive of the potential
debt trap that it might put Bangladesh in. Bangladesh should not get swayed awayby the possibilities that BRI opens up for the country; rather it should carefully
weight its options and make wise and informed decision for the greater interest
of the country.",0.136742424,0.429924242,,Positive

was ready to work with Bangladesh and extend more cooperation in big projects here. Afterward,

China relations were now at a new historical turning point and heading towards a promising
future. “China-Bangladesh cooperation will deliver more fruits for the people of the two
countries, and will contribute to peace and stability and development in the region,” he said. Xi
said they had agreed to elevate China-Bangladesh relationship from a ‘Closer Comprehensive
Partnership of Cooperation’ to a ‘Strategic Partnership of Cooperation.’ Both sides also agreed to
increase high-level exchanges and strategic communication so that bilateral relations move ahead
at even a higher level, he said. Terming his meeting with Prime Minister Hasina ‘warm and
productive,’ the Chinese president said they reached agreements on a number of important issues.
“We have agreed to jointly advance the road and belt initiative,” Xi said, adding that they had
also agreed to launch a joint feasibility study on China-Bangladesh Free Trade Agreement to
strengthen trade and investment cooperation. The Chinese president laid emphasis on enhancing
practical cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure, production capacity, energy and power,
transportation, ICT and agriculture. He said China would continue to do its best in providing
capital, technical and human resources to carry out close cooperation on projects to support
economic and social development of Bangladesh. The two countries also agreed to designate the
year 2017 as the year of ‘exchange and friendship’ between Bangladesh and China during which
colorful events will be held to carry forward the friendship. They also laid emphasis on
institutionalising cooperation on maritime affairs, counter-terrorism, advance the BCIM
Economic Corridor and increase communication and coordination on international and regional
issues. “China is ready to work with Bangladesh as friends and partners with trust and support to
each other,” said the Chinese president. Prime Minister Hasina said: “Today, we have elevated
our ‘Closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation’ to a ‘Strategic Partnership for
Cooperation’ and under this strategic partnership, we have agreed to work towards socio-
economic advancement of the peoples of our two countries.” She said they reached a consensus
on cooperation in key areas such as trade and investment, infrastructure, industry, power, and
energy, information and communication technology and agriculture. They witnessed the signing
of 27 agreements and MoUs of cooperation that cover, among others, trade, investment, blue
economy, BCIM-EC, roads, and bridges, railways, power, maritime, ICT, Industrial production,
capacity building and skill development. Both leaders also unveiled the plaques of six projects
adding that the signing of these instruments and the unveiling of these plaques created a platform
for the two countries to cooperate at a higher plane. The prime minister said her government’s
efforts today were aimed at attaining the goals of becoming a knowledge-based middle-income
country by 2021 and eventually a developed country by 2041. She also said that they had very
fruitful discussions on bilateral, regional and international issues of common interest. “We have
reiterated our commitment to support the ‘One China Policy.’ We have agreed to work closely
and support each other on regional and international issues of mutual interest.” Elaborating on the

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/7350/a-new-beginning 2/4enhanced security cooperation agreed by the two leaders, Foreign Secretary Md Shahidul Haque
said the two countries would now work together to fight terrorism and militancy, particularly by
capacity building and exchange of information and good practices. “A MoU on the issue has been
signed after the talks,” he said.mDuring the talks, Shahidul said, the Chinese side hinted at
making special investment in RMG and jute sectors. As part of a consensus on enhanced
economic cooperation, the two countries inked a framework agreement on production capacity
building after the talks, the foreign secretary said, adding that under the deal, the Chinese
government would assist Bangladesh in technology transfer, capacity building, training and
establishment of new entities. He said China would make an investment involving a huge amount
in the ICT sector in Bangladesh to help materialise its vision of building Digital Bangladesh.
Haque said during the talks the Chinese president highly appreciated Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina’s leadership and Bangladesh’s stunning achievement in different sectors under her able
stewardship. The foreign secretary said the two leaders pledged to work together to implement
the sustainable development goals. Maritime was a new area where the two countries agreed for
collaboration and the two countries signed a MoU for cooperation on blue economy. Shahidul
said the foreign ministers of the two countries signed another MoU to support the ‘One Belt One
Road’, a connectivity initiative of the Chinese president. The foreign secretary said several other
MoUs were signed in the private sector and that these would strengthen ties between the two
nation’s private sectors particularly in the areas of trade and investment. Asked about the
estimated financial value of the agreements and MoUs, he said: “You will have to wait a few days
to know about the total financial involvement of the projects.” But he said the two leaders agreed
that the development of the people of the two countries was most crucial for bilateral ties.
Without any elaboration, the foreign secretary said an agreement was signed on economic and
technical cooperation and a framework agreement on road and tunnel. President Xi led a 13-
member high powered Chinese delegation at the talks. They included two senior members of
Politburo of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China Wang Huning and Li Zhanshu,
State Councilor Yang Jiechi, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Minister of National Development and
Reform Commission Xu Shaoshi, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei, Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng
and Governor of the People’s Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina led
the Bangladesh side that comprised of Finance Minister AMA Muhith, Industries Minister Amir
Hossain Amu, Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed, Public Administration Minister Syed Ashraful
Islam, Minister for Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader, Foreign Minister AH Mahmood
Ali and Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal. Upon his arrival at the Prime Minister’s Office
around 3pm, Sheikh Hasina received Xi at the Tiger Gate of the PMO and then the two leaders
held a tête-à-tête for about ten minutes. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Dhaka this
morning on a historic state visit amid high hopes in Bangladesh that it will be the beginning of a
historic new journey towards opening up a new horizon in bilateral relations.

Myanmar while it conducted atrocities against the Rohingyas, speakers said at a symposium on
Saturday.
Professor Afsan Chowdhury – veteran journalist accused China of backing Myanmar in cleansing
of Rohingyas from Rakhine by the Myanmar security forces.
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Zhang Zuo, who attended the symposium on “Bangladesh-
China Relations: Prognosis for the Future” as chief guest, did not make comment on this at the
program.
However, when asked to comment on the accusation on his way out, he said: “China always plays
a constructive role”.
When asked about the upcoming election scheduled for December 30, the Chinese envoy,
through an interpreter, expressed hope that the poll will go “well and smooth” and that
Bangladesh and the political parties can do that.
He avoided a direct answer when asked if China will send election observers to monitor the polls.
The Cosmos Foundation organized the event at a city hotel. Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury,
principal Research Fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of
Singapore, and former Adviser on Foreign Affairs to the Caretaker Government, chaired the event
while Cosmos Foundation Chairman Enayetullah Khan delivered the welcome address.

University Professor Afsan Chowdhury and Chief Journalist of India Bureau of People’s Daily
Yuan Jirong took part as panel discussants at the symposium attended by diplomats, academia,
civil and military officials and journalists.
Emphasizing on the importance of the Dhaka-Beijing relationship, speakers said that there is a
consensus among the people of Bangladesh in regards to good relations with China and people
are not happy with the Chinese support for Myanmar on the Rohingya crisis.
The Chinese leadership will have re-think their approach on the Rohingya issue, they said.
The speakers also said that if the Rohingya crisis is not solved, initiatives like BCIM
(Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar) Economic Corridor and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will
be negatively affected.
Some of the speakers questioned the government’s negotiating skills in every aspect, especially
on Rohingya issue, and the “independence” of the country’s foreign policy while few serving and
former senior diplomats defended the government’s handling of the Rohingya crisis along with
other issues and the existing foreign policy.
The speakers pointed out that although there are many good sides of the Chinese Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), Bangladesh will also have to be careful about the “other side of the coin”.  
“All-out efforts should be made so that the outcome is always a win-win for both the countries,”
they added. 
Chinese Ambassador Zuo recalled President Xi Jinping’s visit to Bangladesh in 2016 and said
that the strategic partnership forged during the visit opened a new chapter of the Dhaka-Beijing
relationship.
He emphasized on deepening strategic engagements based on equality and mutual trust, saying
that Bangladesh and China will have to be good partners to make the most of the relationship.

BNP senior leader Dr Abul Moyeen Khan on Tuesday unequivocally told Yunnan Province
leaders that if his party comes to power, it would prioritise deepening strategic and
diplomatic relations with China to ensure a balance of geopolitical power.
 
""It's simple that we are in a geographical position where, on three sides, we are encircled
by a big and powerful country. We need to balance and bring equilibrium to our
geopolitical role and location through our close relationship with China,"" he told a meeting
with Yunnan Province Vice Governor Xu Hao.
 
He said this diplomatic and strategic balancing is essential for the survival of Bangladesh. ""I
sincerely wish, as in the past, China will continue to offer its fullest support to Bangladesh
and its people.""
 
A 21-member Bangladesh friendship delegation, led by Dr Moyeen Khan, attended the
meeting at the Foreign Affairs Office of the People's Government of Yunnan Province.
 
Senior officials from various departments of the provincial government were present.
 
On behalf of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia and Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman, Dr
Moyeen extended heartfelt congratulations to the Communist Party of China and Yunnan
provincial leaders.
 
He also noted that Khaleda Zia has been a consistent and longstanding friend of China for
several decades.
 
Dr Moyeen said the BNP's Acting Chairman has sent them to China with wishes to
strengthen future collaboration and friendship between China and Bangladesh.
 
Following the mass uprising in Bangladesh last year, he said, political parties, including
BNP, have been eagerly waiting for a national election.
 
""If our party, BNP, along with our allies, is elected by people and forms the government, our
first steps will be to strengthen our friendship with the people of China. This is a
commitment from BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman,"" he said.
 
He said the people of Bangladesh have long regarded China as one of their trusted friends.
 
Dr Moyeen said Bangladesh is one-third the size of Yunnan, but its population is three times
larger, highlighting the immense pressure on the government to ensure that people receive
their rightful benefits and privileges.
 
He said Bangladesh is primarily an agriculture-based country, much like Yunnan province.BN25/05/2025, 15:27 BNP vows to strengthen ties with China if elected, seeks strategic balance | The Financial Express

""Bangladesh is striving to develop industrially, especially in the Ready Made Garment
(RMG) sector, as well as in other areas, though not as successfully as we have in the garment
sector,"" he observed.
 
The BNP leader urged Chinese authorities to extend their cooperation in the agricultural
and financial sectors of Bangladesh.
 
He mentioned that the Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka has already indicated support for a
water management project along one of the country's major rivers, the Teesta.
 
Dr Moyeen said the Chinese Ambassador has also indicated that China would support a $1
billion investment to implement this water management and irrigation project.
 
He said millions of poor people, particularly farmers, would greatly benefit if the project is
implemented.
 
Dr Moyeen expressed the hope that steps would be taken in the future to initiate the project
with China's cooperation.
 
As Yunnan is very close to China, Dr Moyeen said this province serves as a gateway to China
for Bangladesh to enhance bilateral trade and commerce.
 
He stressed the importance of implementing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), connecting
Bangladesh with China via Myanmar. ""We are eagerly waiting for the initiation and
completion of this segment of the BRI. Kunming can play a very important role in this
regard.""
 
Dr Moyeen mentioned that while Bangladesh shares a large common border with a big
country in Southeast Asia, it does not have a direct border with China. ""But we believe
China is Bangladesh's closest neighbour.""
 
Yunnan Province Vice Governor Xu Hao responded by stating that China, particularly the
Yunnan provincial government, considers Bangladesh a very close and important
neighbour.
 
He expressed the hope that the people-to-people relationship between China and
Bangladesh would continue to grow in the future.
 
Xu Hao also said Yunnan is eager to assist Bangladesh's renewable energy and agricultural
sectors.
 
He also said four top hospitals in Yunnan have been designated to specifically treat
Bangladeshi patients.
 
The Yunaan leader said many universities in Yunnan have become popular study
destinations for South Asian countries. ""We warmly welcome more Bangladeshi students to
study in Yunnan and we""ll offer various scholarships for them.""
 
Earlier, on February 25, a 21-member 'unique' delegation, comprising leaders from eight
political parties, including the BNP, travelled to China for an 11-day visit at the invitation of
the Communist Party of China (CPC).

What should be the next foreign policy priorities for Bangladesh?
Md Himel Rahman
Update : 13 F eb 2024, 09:24 AM
As Bangladesh is scheduled to graduate from the group of least developed countries (LDCs) in
2026, the graduation is likely to bring about qualitative changes in Bangladesh’s diplomatic

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/339282/taking-charge-in-the-international-arena 1/6relations with the rest of the world, especially in terms of its economic ties with the developed
states.
The geopolitical situation in the Indo-Pacific region is already heated, and great and regional
powers are currently engaged in a strategic competition for influence in the region. Moreover,
with a full-scale civil war raging in Myanmar and unrest brewing in Northeast India,
Bangladesh’s immediate neighbourhood is currently on fire. And to add further fuel to the
turmoil, an economic crisis looms over Bangladesh, as the country is suffering from fluctuating
forex reserves and high inflation.
Taking into account the current geopolitical realities and Bangladesh’s national interests, the
government needs to carefully determine their foreign policy objectives and priorities.
 
Repairing relations with the US
Under the administration of US President Joseph Biden, US-Bangladeshi ties were somewhat
strained, owing to a host of factors, including the imposition of US sanctions on RAB, the
recurring US concerns about the fairness of Bangladesh’s election and labour rights, and the
announcement of the US intent to sanction the persons who would seek to “undermine”
democratic elections in the country.
However, after the election, the US Department of State vowed to work with the new
Bangladeshi government, and in a letter to the Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,
x25/05/2025, 15:16 Taking charge in the international arena
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/339282/taking-charge-in-the-international-arena 2/6President Biden expressed his desire to work with Bangladesh, particularly on economic and
Indo-Pacific affairs. This signals that the US is unlikely to undertake harsh politico-economic
measures against Bangladesh in the near future and the US reaction to Bangladesh’s internal
political situation will remain restricted to sanctions on particular individuals.
Geopolitical and economic realities stipulate that Dhaka and Washington should preserve their
traditionally cordial and mutually beneficial multifaceted partnership. Bangladesh holds strategic
significance for the US in the context of the intensification of geopolitical competition in the
Indo-Pacific region. On the other hand, the US is the largest market for Bangladeshi readymade
garment (RMG) products and the largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country.
Hence, Dhaka should minimize and compartmentalize the frictions it has with Washington, and
instead work towards expanding its partnership with the US.
 
Deepening ties with the EU
At present, Bangladesh maintains a strong and stable partnership with the EU. Yet, there are some
concerns about the future of this. The EU has expressed its concerns over Bangladesh’s human
rights situation and labour laws, and after Bangladesh’s graduation from the LDC may subject the
country’s exports to new tariff barriers in the EU.
Under these circumstances, Dhaka should conclude the “Partnership Cooperation Agreement”
with the EU and undertake appropriate politico-diplomatic steps to ensure that Bangladesh is
accorded the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Plus facilities in the EU after 2026. In
addition, Dhaka should enhance its security partnership with Brussels, particularly in the sphere
of acquisition of military hardware.
 
Navigating the Sino-Indian strategic competition
Bangladesh shares comprehensive political, diplomatic, economic, military, and cultural relations
with both China and India. Tellingly, China and India are respectively the largest and the second
largest trade partners of Bangladesh. Meanwhile the two are at loggerheads with each other over
exerting their influence in South Asia. In the current context, New Delhi is likely to expect Dhaka
to align with its “Look East” and “Act East” policies, while Beijing is expected to enhance its
development finance relations with Dhaka under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
x25/05/2025, 15:16 Taking charge in the international arena
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/339282/taking-charge-in-the-international-arena 3/6Hence, Bangladesh should pursue a foreign policy vis-à-vis the Sino–Indian rivalry that aims at
maintaining a healthy and delicate balance between Chinese and Indian interests in the country.
At the same time, Dhaka should strive to boost its strategic partnerships with both Beijing and
New Delhi. Dhaka should also undertake necessary politico-diplomatic measures to resolve its
existing disputes with India, while expanding cooperation across all sectors.
 
Manoeuvring the Myanmar conundrum and the Rohingya crisis
Bangladesh has deep ties with neighbouring Myanmar, but political instability in its southeastern
neighbour has profoundly affected Bangladesh’s security, economy and politics. Since 2017,
Bangladesh has hosted more than 1.3 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.
At present, Myanmar is in a state of civil war, and since the start of Operation 1027 in October
2023, the situation has only worsened. Bangladesh faces gunfire, mortar attacks, and even
gunship strikes from Myanmar territory, and recently, more than 300 Myanmar troops and
security personnel have illegally intruded into Bangladeshi territory.
Bangladesh has consistently sought the repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, without
success. Now, the intensification of the war in Myanmar has opened the possibility of a new
influx of refugees to Bangladesh, which would cause an unmitigated disaster for the country.
Hence, measures to secure borders and prevent the war in Myanmar from spilling into the
country is necessary. Dhaka must continue its diplomatic initiatives with Nay Pyi Taw and the
international community to ensure the repatriation of Rohingya refugees.
 
Strengthening economic and energy diplomacy
Bangladesh should prioritize economic development while formulating its foreign policy. Amid
the looming economic crisis, Bangladeshi policy-makers should put special emphasis on
economic and energy diplomacy.
On the economic front, the Bangladeshi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) should undertake
necessary steps to encourage foreign investors, lenders, and donors to work with Bangladesh.
Also, numerous states across the world, ranging from Mongolia to Tanzania, are willing to import
Bangladeshi skilled and semi-skilled workers, and the MoFA should accordingly develop
economic ties with these states to increase the flow of remittances to the country.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/339282/taking-charge-in-the-international-arena 4/6Moreover, some Bangladeshi entrepreneurs are achieving sound commercial successes abroad,
exemplified by the success of Bangladeshi Internet providers in South Sudan. The MoFA should
assist Bangladeshi entrepreneurs in such ventures.
On the energy front, Bangladesh should conduct more government-to-government (G2G)
agreements with energy-exporting countries to ensure its long-term energy and economic
security. Dhaka should expand scientific and technological cooperation with advanced states to
obtain technology for building refineries, power plants, and other energy installations.
 
Cultivating a positive national image
Bangladesh has upheld a positive image for itself before the international community through its
strong commitment to international peace and security, its non-aligned foreign policy, its
significant contribution to United Nations (UN) peacekeeping, and its support for oppressed
peoples worldwide, including in Gaza. In future, Dhaka could perhaps make its voice heard in the
global arena by energetically promoting international peace and security.
In order to build a secure, peaceful, and prosperous future for the nation, Bangladesh should
pursue a well-defined, calculated, and balanced foreign policy for the next five years.

He made the remarks at the launching ceremony of a Chinese publication by private think-tank Center for
East Asia Foundation (CEAF) in Dhaka on Saturday . 
“Bangladesh is proud to be a part of this initiative,” he said, ahead of the BRI Summit in Beijing next week.
Bangladesh joined the BRI during Chinese President Xi Jinping’ s visit to Dhaka in Oct 2016. The initiative
aims to rebuild the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond through massive
infrastructural spending.
Dhaka is also sending a high-profile delegation led by Minister for Industries Nurul Majid Mahmud
Humayun for the summit which will be held between Apr 25 and Apr 28.
Prime minister ’s daughter Saima W azed Hossain, who is a WHO mental health expert, has  also been

https://bdnews24.com/economy/chinas-belt-and-road-fits-into-bangladeshs-priority-gowher-rizvi 2/9However , the initiative has been the subject of controversy in many W estern capitals, particularly
Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and trap countries into
debt through “nontransparent” projects.
India also opted against joining the BRI citing concerns over China’ s projects with Pakistan. Some analysts
say India is not comfortable with Bangladesh’ s joining the initiative.
But the prime minister ’s adviser did not respond to a question on the matter at the launch of the ‘The Belt
and Road’  magazine.
In his speech, he said Bangladesh had been in favour of the initiative even before its announcement. 
“We had our own BCIM (Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar Economic Corridor) which is essentially a
reduced version of the Belt and Road Initiative,” he said.
“Bangladesh is extremely successful in managing its foreign relations,” added Gowher .
“It has always avoided taking sides,” he said, referring to the foreign policy dictum ‘friendship to all, malice
to none’.×          World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Economy Business Cricket Hello Stripe Recent25/05/2025, 10:58 China’s Belt and Road fits into Bangladesh’s priority: Gowher Rizvi

had spectacular success through its ability to maintain outstanding relations with China, India, Japan,
Soviet Union, United States and western European countries.”
Gowher said that this has helped Bangladesh to become what it is today .
“Bangladesh has become a model of development and innovation.”

Currently engaged in major infrastructure-development projects in Bangladesh, China signals its readiness to
expand collaboration into digital, marine and green economies, and widen medical visas and scholarship quotas
for Bangladeshi citizens.
Also, China stands ready to participate in the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration
Project, Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen said Wednesday while rolling out their latest cooperation
outlook.
And Beijing will continue to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and explore further cooperation in
the fields of digital economy, green economy, marine economy, infrastructure, and water conservancy.
""China will further deepen comprehensive reforms and expand high-level opening-up, bringing new opportunities
for development to Bangladesh and countries around the world,"" the ambassador told his audience at the
opening ceremony of training programmes arranged for Bangladeshi officials by China Aid in Dhaka.
Ms. Mirana Mahrukh, Additional Secretary, Wing Chief of ERD, the Ministry of Finance, and Mr. Mohammed
Nore-Alam, Director-General at the East Asia and Pacific Wing of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also spoke at
the event.
As previously noted, this year, China will organise 23 bilateral seminars and 30 multilateral seminars, training
over 500 Bangladeshi participants to equip them with the know-how to advance interaction on modern-day
development front. These seminars will cover areas such as smart governance and information technology, new
energy, finance, transportation, agriculture, tourism, and education.
Mr Wen notes economic and trade cooperation and people-to-people exchanges serve as cornerstones of
comprehensive cooperation.
""The meeting between Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus and Chinese President Xi Jinping
held in Beijing last month marked a new phase of development in China-Bangladesh relations and elevated the
'Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership' between the two countries to an unprecedented height,"" the

has become a broad consensus in the Bangladeshi society that China is the most trustworthy and reliable
development partner,"" he said.
The Chinese Ambassador said the recent tariff imposed by the Trump administration of the United States
""severely infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of all countries, severely violates WTO rules,
severely undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, and severely disrupts the global economic
order"".
In this context, ""China stands ready to work with Bangladesh and all nations to advance economic globalization
towards greater openness and inclusiveness with balanced benefits, so as to build a fair world of common
development.""

25/05/2025, 11:47 What is China's role in promoting inclusive growth in Bangladesh? | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/what-is-chinas-role-in-promoting-inclusive-growth-in-bangladesh-1641647371 1/10country has reduced poverty significantly and concomitantly secured a position among the
world's fastest growing economies.
As data from the World Bank in Bangladesh shows, for a country that had the world's tenth
lowest per capita GDP in 1971, to reduce poverty from 43.5 per cent in 1991 to 14.3 per cent
in 2016, is definitely an accomplishment that cannot be hidden under a bushel. While
Bangladesh's recent achievement is commendable, the country's next hurdle is to graduate
from the United Nations Least Developed Countries in 2026, a goal that is being threatened
by the COVID-19 pandemic which has wiped out years of hard-earned social and economic
gains in Bangladesh.
According to the World Bank, the country's poverty rate rose from 14.4 per cent to 18.1 per
cent in 2020 and at the same time, inequality has also increased across several dimensions.
To effectively address this setback and recover completely, policymakers in Bangladesh
should focus on strengthening infrastructure development to accelerate economic growth
that is inclusive growth.
By developing efficient infrastructure, the country could gain the required inclusive
economic growth and has the tendency to effectively address the current social and
economic woes. In fact, this approach will be the surest means to solve COVID-19 related
problems, bolster economic growth, mitigate inequality and alleviate poverty in
Bangladesh.
Currently, the economy of Bangladesh relies heavily on sectors such as the ready-made
garments, agriculture and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, a wide
infrastructure gap in key sectors such as energy, transportation, information
communications technology (ICT), is limiting productivity, stalling business innovation and
creating a difficult business environment that is impeding industry growth. Collectively,
these deficiencies are constraining the country's economic growth and limiting inclusive
growth at the same time.
According to the Global Innovation Index 2021, a comprehensive report that examined the
innovation ecosystem performance of 132 economies that was published by the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a specialized agency of the United Nations,
Bangladesh was ranked 95th in the area of Infrastructure. In terms of business environment
and the overall performance, the country was ranked 117 and 116, respectively.
Furthermore, for ICT access and ICT use, Bangladesh was ranked 103 and 108, respectively.
Addressing these bottlenecks, or infrastructure gaps, is critical for promoting equal access
to opportunities, improving the competitiveness of domestic industries and also25/05/2025, 11:47 What is China's role in promoting inclusive growth in Bangladesh? | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/what-is-chinas-role-in-promoting-inclusive-growth-in-bangladesh-1641647371 2/10augmenting the overall efficiency of the economy which are all essential for attaining
inclusive growth.
Practically, developing infrastructure to accelerate economic growth that has the tendency
to create decent jobs and enhance access to opportunities for all segments of society
(particularly the less privileged) has not been a walk in the park for policymakers in
Bangladesh. However, China, the country's top investor, is playing a significant role to bring
this goal to fruition in the country.
Through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and other infrastructure development projects
that are supported by China, Bangladesh is expected to bridge its infrastructure gap
considerably in the years ahead. For example, a BRI project such as the construction of the
6.15 kilometre Padma Bridge Rail Link valued at $3.3 billion will boost connectivity across
the country and the entire South Asia upon completion.
Again, the upgrade of the 48-kilometre Dhaka BypassExpressway to dual carriageway, an
arrangement between China-Bangladesh Consortium, will also truncate travel time
between the northern part of the country and the Chittagong port, Bangladesh's main
seaport - for transportation projects alone, China has invested about $9.75 billion in
Bangladesh from 2009 to 2019.
Together with other BRI infrastructure projects, China's unflinching support to Bangladesh
is contributing significantly in filling the infrastructure gap of the South Asian country. All
these infrastructure development projects are invaluable additions that will strengthen the
much needed solution to the country's growing energy demand, improve mobility within
urban and rural areas, enhance business innovation, add value and increase productivity
especially in the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector.
In my recent article for The Diplomat, where I discussed how SMEs could spur inclusive
growth in Bangladesh. I indicated that by 2019 the country's SMEs sector had reached a
total of 7.8 million enterprises and contributed 25 per cent of Bangladesh's GDP. This
massive contribution is a clear indication that growth in the SMEs sector cannot be
overlooked when pursuing inclusive growth.
Therefore, with China investing adequately to bridge the infrastructure gaps in Bangladesh,
this provision will solve two main problems; while the SMEs sector and the economic
landscape as a whole will leverage the infrastructure development to enhance innovation,
foster value addition and boost productivity, and ultimately promote growth which will
expand economic opportunities, the advancement in infrastructure will concurrently
strengthen access to these opportunities which will ensure that low-income households25/05/2025, 11:47 What is China's role in promoting inclusive growth in Bangladesh? | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/what-is-chinas-role-in-promoting-inclusive-growth-in-bangladesh-1641647371 3/10and impoverished communities can benefit immensely from the growth in the SMEs sector
and other social and economic opportunities.
In fact, poor and low-income households will experience an enhanced connectivity to
markets and other basic productive assets which will mitigate inequality, eradicate extreme
poverty and improve their standards of living.
Furthermore, from July, 2020 till date China has been providing duty-free access to 97 per
cent of products from Bangladesh, representing 8,256 products, a move that has presented
another window of opportunity for SMEs and other business entities in the country to
expand as they tap into China's colossal market.
Overall, China's infrastructure investments and trade agreements have not only proved to
be a catalyst that is contributing significantly in accelerating inclusive growth which is
reducing poverty, alleviating extreme inequality as poor and low-income households are
experiencing, but also improved access to education, healthcare and job opportunities in
Bangladesh.

'Prof Yunus is very famous in the world of economics and development; privilege for our
university to honour him'
Chief Adviser Pr ofessor Muhammad Y unus. Phot o: Bangla Tribune
UNB
Update : 18 Apr 2025, 10:10 AM
Nobel laureate Prof Dr Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh’s interim government, has
demonstrated the transformative power of thinking beyond traditional economic frameworks,Publish : 18 Apr 2025, 10:10 AM25/05/2025, 16:01 Yunus proved impact of innovative economics, says Peking University's Yao Tang
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/378989/yao-tang-dr-yunus-proved-impact-of-innovative 1/3according to Dr Yao Tang, associate professor of applied economics at the Guanghua School of
Management, Peking University.
Tang lauded Yunus's innovative approach to microfinance and social business, calling it a timely
reminder that real impact comes from courage, creativity, and a commitment to change.
He said Yunus is a very prominent economist, as he had training in the United States and, more
importantly, has spent a significant part of his career in microfinancing.
Replying to a question regarding the honorary doctorate conferred upon Prof Yunus by Peking
University, he said Prof Yunus is very famous in the world of economics and development,
including in China. ""It is both appropriate and a privilege for our university to honour him,"" Dr
Tang added.
Peking University, known for its excellence in economics and social sciences, found in Prof
Yunus’s life work a natural synergy.
The university has a strong tradition in development studies, with prominent scholars like Prof
Justin Yifu Lin, a former chief economist of the World Bank, among its faculty.
In assessing Nobel laureate Prof Yunus’ global contributions, Dr Tang highlighted the uniqueness
of his work in pioneering community-based financing.
“Prof Yunus has introduced a model of financing that was not part of mainstream Western
economics. His approach to community-based microfinance is a significant innovation that has
reshaped global thinking about poverty alleviation and social empowerment.”
According to Dr Tang, Peking University is deeply invested in the development discourse and
finds strong alignment between its own academic ethos and the values embodied in Prof Yunus’
work.
“Our university has historically been tied to major ideas and movements within China’s
development process. We highly appreciate the work done by Prof Yunus, and he has indeed
influenced us, especially in development economics,” he said.
Asked how Prof Yunus' message resonates with the younger generation, Dr Tang focused on the
growing shortcomings of traditional western economic models and the need for innovative
thinking. “The western model, particularly in the United States, has shown increasing signs of
strain — from financial overdependence to rising inequality. This tells us that alternative models
are essential,” he said.25/05/2025, 16:01 Yunus proved impact of innovative economics, says Peking University's Yao Tang
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/378989/yao-tang-dr-yunus-proved-impact-of-innovative 2/3Prof Yunus has shown the importance of thinking outside the typical boxes and being brave
enough to innovate and make a meaningful impact on society, he added.
He mentioned that the honorary recognition is not only a tribute to Prof Yunus but also a new
chapter of collaboration between China and Bangladesh in the academic and development
sectors.
This honour will surely inspire greater collaboration between institutions in China and
Bangladesh. “We are very interested in Prof Yunus’s vision and how it can contribute to broader
development goals in his country and beyond,” he added.
Looking ahead, Dr Tang hinted at potential future collaborations between Bangladesh and China.
“There is growing interest in studying social enterprises and microfinancing models. After
decades of practice, there are still many important lessons to uncover, and we expect joint
research, seminars, and programmes to emerge from this,"" he said.
Prof Yunus' visit sparked widespread enthusiasm and admiration across the Peking University
campus.
“People were genuinely and pleasantly surprised. While we had important events lined up for late
March, the news of Prof Yunus receiving the honorary degree came as a delightful moment. It
brought pride and joy to our entire community, especially the students,” Dr Tang said.
With this recognition, Peking University not only celebrated the life work of a global pioneer but
also reinforced the importance of rethinking conventional models to address contemporary
challenges — a message that continues to inspire future generations worldwide.

China’s role as mediator and what it
means for Bangladesh
Wed Jul 5, 2023 11:00 AM
Last update on: Wed Jul 5, 2023 11:00 AM
China achieved an unprecedented diplomatic breakthrough by mediating the
Saudi-Iranian rapprochement, whereby both parties agreed to restore diplomatic
relations and resume direct flights between their two nations. Although, to some
experts, this deal may come as a surprise, China's stride towards taking up the
mantle as a mediator has been in the works for the past two decades. 
Although China’s mediation effort increased from 2013, it had been running its course prior for quite some time. FILE

The Chinese principle of mediation 
China uses the Confucian approach of ""harmony as the instrumentality"" to
resolve disputes through moral persuasion and consultation, rather than
coercion. Under such a context, Chinese foreign policy has developed persuading
for peace and promoting dialogues towards regional conflict. Based on this, China
strives to protect its economic interest, desire to raise its international stature,
and a recognition of its responsibilities as a rising power. Thus, the core principle
of China's foreign policy is non-interference. Under such light, facilitation and
mediation is adopted by China tethering its image as the ""mediator"".

China’s role is key to resolving the Rohingya crisis
China's role as the 'mediator'
Although China's mediation effort increased from 2013 (when the Belt and Road
Initiative was launched), it had been running its course prior for quite some time.
In 2002, China established a special envoy for issues in the Middle East, the
primary purpose having been to contribute to the resolution of Palestinian-Israeli
and Arab-Israeli conflicts. In 2004, during the Darfur crisis, it appointed a special
envoy for African affairs, aimed to exert quiet pressure on the Sudanese regime to
improve the humanitarian situation in Darfur, cease the killing, and work to
resolve the crisis. Chinese mediation efforts from President Hu Jintao and then-
Vice President Xi Jinping eventually persuaded Sudan to cooperate with the
international community, and consent to a UN peacekeeping force in Darfur. 
China conducts its diplomatic engagement through three cooperation forums: the
Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), the China-Arab States Cooperation
Forum (CASCF), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). These
organisations are China's primary multilateral coordination mechanisms for
political, economic, and security interactions. 
Where does Bangladesh stand? 
Bangladesh is an important geostrategic region in South Asia as it sits right
between Southeast  Asia and South Asia. Furthermore, it's a getaway to a market
of an estimated 3.5 billion people, making the country an economic and
commercial hub. As part of China's larger geopolitical scheme, Bangladesh
formally entered the BRI in 2015. The following year, Chinese President Xi
Jinping's historic visit to Dhaka took Bangladesh-China relations to a new height.
Safe to say, Bangladesh is an important ally to China. This is further proven by the
fact that China has granted Bangladesh duty-free access to 97 percent of tariff
products under the duty-free and quota-free scheme.

China is also the biggest foreign investor in Bangladesh, in addition to the latter
being the second-largest recipient of Chinese funds in South Asia, following
Pakistan. Besides being a development partner, China has taken up the role of a
mediator in the Rohingya refugee crisis, too. Although the crisis has not yet
reached a conclusive settlement, China is still considered the primary actor for
facilitating an agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar. China has offered
the ""three-phase solution"", which is a trilateral initiative among Bangladesh-
Myanmar-China.

Rohingya Repatriation: China’s role as mediator very
crucial
However, China's endeavour mustn't be viewed in an unalloyed light. Although it
arranged three meetings from 2018 to 2020 between Bangladesh and Myanmar, no
apparent development has been seen. Moreover, the 2021 coup, leading to a socio-
political chaos resulting in a civil war and sudden surge in Covid-19 cases across
Myanmar, has stockpiled more complexities onto an already strenuous mediation
process. Besides, critics have called out China for blocking the UN Security
Council from issuing a statement of concern over violence across Myanmar.
Despite the growing frustration and ongoing stalemate, China's role as a mediator
has enough teeth in conflict resolution. As for Bangladesh, embracing a cautious
but optimistic approach will fare well. However, the country must tread carefully
in the ""new great game"", which is expected to be centred around Asia, if it wants
to reap its benefits.

Relations from the University of Dhaka.

How China’s green energy strategy can
inspire Bangladesh
Fri Mar 28, 2025 12:00 PM
Last update on: Fri Mar 28, 2025 03:42 PM
China has emerged as a global leader in the green energy sector, making
significant strides in transitioning to renewable and sustainable energy sources.
This is a crucial part of China's environmental goals and commitment to
achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.
China’s model of incentivising renewable energy infrastructure development could be replicated in Bangladesh,
encouraging private and public sector investment. PHOTO: REUTERS
Over the past decade, the country has invested heavily in green technologies,
such as solar, wind and hydropower, while reducing its reliance on coal. In 2024,
China became home to the world's largest solar and wind energy capacities as
well as the largest electric vehicle market.
Additionally, it is a major player in the manufacturing of solar panels, wind
turbines, and energy storage systems. China's leadership in addressing domestic
environmental challenges is positioning the country as a key influence in global
environmental policies and technologies.
A central strategy behind the success in green energy is aggressive investment in
renewable energy infrastructure. For example, tax breaks and low-interest loans
for solar and wind energy companies have spurred innovation and growth.
Alongside investments in energy production, China has developed an extensive
electric vehicle network to reduce emissions from transportation, one of the
largest sources of pollution in the country.

How will Bangladesh-China relations shape up?
Sichuan Shudao Equipment and Technology Co, a leading company in the
renewable energy sector, has made significant strides in promoting green
technology, especially in wind and solar energy. The company develops and
manufactures advanced equipment for clean energy generation. Its expertise in
wind turbine production and solar panel efficiency has positioned it as a
prominent player in China's green energy transition, contributing to the country's
goal of reducing carbon emissions.
Sichuan Shudao excels in the development of high-efficiency wind turbines, with
innovations that increase energy output and lower operational costs, making
wind energy more competitive. Its turbines are designed for both onshore and
offshore applications, expanding the potential for wind power generation. This
technology could also serve as a valuable model for Bangladesh, as we are looking
to diversify the energy mix and reduce our environmental footprint.
The company has also advanced solar energy solutions by developing high-
performance solar panels using innovative materials and production techniques.
These are now deployed in large-scale projects, including solar farms that power
entire regions.
Sichuan Shudao is also exploring energy storage solutions to ensure solar energy
availability even when sunlight is scarce. This combined focus on generation and
storage is key to creating a reliable renewable energy supply.
For countries like Bangladesh, which experience high sunlight levels but face
energy access challenges, taking a leaf out of Sichuan Shudao's book on solar
technologies could be crucial in meeting the growing demand for clean energy.
With deteriorating environmental conditions, China's green energy methods
could provide significant guidance to Bangladesh, which has long struggled with
poor air quality, particularly in Dhaka, where pollution levels rank among the
worst in the world. This has caused public health issues, including respiratory
diseases, cardiovascular problems, and premature deaths.
Additionally, Bangladesh's reliance on coal and fossil fuels significantly
contributes to its carbon footprint. Shifting to renewable energy could reduce
pollution and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. By taking inspiration from
China's green energy strategies, Bangladesh could design measures to reduce its
reliance on coal and natural gas. With abundant sunlight and wind resources, the
country has the potential to harness these renewable sources.

China's model of incentivising renewable energy infrastructure development
could be replicated in Bangladesh, encouraging private and public sector
investment. Offering tax incentives for solar panel installation or wind farm
development could promote the widespread adoption of these clean energy
sources. By investing in energy storage, Bangladesh could ensure renewable
energy availability even during low-production periods. Shifting towards green
energy would significantly improve air quality, with a reduction in coal-fired
power plants and the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.
Furthermore, Bangladesh could learn from China's ""green manufacturing""
initiatives, where industries are retrofitted with energy-efficient technologies to
reduce emissions.
In short, China's leadership in green energy offers a model that Bangladesh could
follow to address its air quality issues. By investing in renewable energy, energy
storage, and green technologies, Bangladesh could reduce its environmental
footprint, improve public health, and build a sustainable energy future. Through
targeted policies, incentives, and long-term investments, Bangladesh could not
only address air quality problems but also contribute to global climate change
efforts.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), reminiscent of the Silk Road, is a long-term
infrastructural project that would stretch from the heart of China, all the way to Europe
which will help Asia cope with infrastructure financing gaps.
This was echoed by President of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS)
Major General ANM Muniruzzaman and Editor of Dhaka Tribune Zafar Sobhan in their
remarks at the BIPSS-Dhaka Tribune Roundtable titled, 'Belt and Road Initiative (BRI):
Connecting the World', which was held at the Westin, reports UNB.
The BRI project of China will create partnership linkages among the sub-regions of South
Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. BRI presents an array of opportunities for
Bangladesh, they said.
The roundtable was attended by diplomats, scholars, security experts, and youth
representatives from various disciplines.
BIPSS President Muniruzzaman highlighted the key facets and variables concerning BRI, the
underlying opportunities and challenges, and what it means for Bangladesh to maintain a
strategic balance being a member of the grand infrastructural initiative.
He said BRI is happening at a time when significant changes are taking place in the
international system, according to a media release issued on Monday.
Zafar Sobhan, editor of The Dhaka Tribune, in his welcome remarks said it is important to
take a deeper look at BRI projects, including how they may affect Bangladesh.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/belt-and-road-initiative-to-create-partnership-linkages-roundtable-1640002749 1/5Muniruzzaman further discussed how Bangladesh has a significant geostrategic role in BRI.
“We expect that BRI projects shouldnʼt cause any harm to the environment,” he added.
While discussing the project of the century, Muniruzzaman focused on how BRI
encompasses several continents in a network of roads and sea-routes.
The first keynote speaker, Dr. Fahmida Khatun, Executive Director of Centre for Policy
Dialogue (CPD), began her remarks with an emphasis on the economic and trade benefits
of BRI, and its implications for Bangladesh.
During her speech, she also highlighted the infrastructural gap currently existing in
Bangladesh and BRI will be a key supplement to fulfilling this gap.
Fahmida Khatun said it is imperative for Bangladesh to follow a cautious approach
regarding Chinese investments.
Highlighting the role of BRI member countries, second keynote speaker Parvez Karim
Abbasi, Assistant Professor of the Department of Economics at East West University, began
his deliberations by talking about the geo-economic implications of BRI for the region.
He also highlighted the fact how the whole project of BRI is actually an integral part of the
Chinese socioeconomic identity.
Abbasi added, “BRI is a concrete manifestation of Chinaʼs emergence as an economic
powerhouse and it will help expand connectivity transcending the borders between
nations.”
He said the fate of China is intrinsically linked to BRI. ""Due to the pandemic, thereʼve been
major economic implications for the world. The small states need to take each step with
precision and clarity. The role of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has to be
studied with in-depth details.""
Summarizing the discussion, Muniruzzaman said although there will be major implications
for the signatory countries, they need to utilise the funds channeled through BRI for the
prosperity of our nation.
An interactive session with the audience was followed who further enriched the discussion.
The participants included foreign diplomats, security sector personnel, scholars and
journalists.

A golden opportunity for Bangladesh?
Wed Feb 5, 2025 09:00 AM
Last update on: Thu Feb 6, 2025 01:14 AM
Over the last four decades, China has established itself as the leading hub for
manufacturing on a global scale. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the
implementation of economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping facilitated the entry
of foreign direct investment (FDI) in China's economy, prompting numerous
companies to shift their manufacturing operations to the country. Nonetheless,
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi tells Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus that China wants to invest in the production of
solar panels in Bangladesh, on September 25, 2024. PHOTO: CA OFFICE
the persistent difficulties faced by the world's second largest economy, including
geopolitical tensions with the United States, environmental regulations and
overcapacity in manufacturing have led China to relocate various industries to
friendly nations in Southeast Asia, South Asia and Central Asia. It's pertinent to
analyse China's industrial relocation and how Bangladesh can benefit from it.
Why are Chinese industries relocating?
First, China is undergoing a significant transformation, influenced by a variety of
economic, geopolitical, environmental and policy issues. This transition is
driving Chinese companies, especially in low-end manufacturing, to explore
alternative regions that provide improved market access with greater outputs.
China has been experiencing an upsurge in production wages and production
costs in recent times, which has led to a decline in the cost competitiveness, once
considered to be the strength of Chinese economy. Furthermore, stringent
environmental regulations have led to a shift in compliance expenses that's
influencing rendering domestic industry to other regions. Last year, Chinese
Premier Li Qiang outlined the yearly economic growth target of five percent
during his inaugural working report at the National People's Congress. He
emphasised the need for a significant advancement through the acceleration of
industry modernisation and the ""development of new quality productive forces.""
The approach that Li Qiang spoke of entails a systematic transition towards high-
end, smart and clean manufacturing sectors, with a strategic relocation of several
domestic industries to emerging economies in their geographical proximity. In
the context of emerging economies, Bangladesh presents itself as a suitable
region for attracting these shifting industries.

How Trump's economic policies will impact South Asia
Additionally, the ongoing tensions in US-China trade and broader decoupling
trends are prompting Chinese firms to adopt a ""China Plus One"" strategy aimed at
diversifying their production bases to mitigate geopolitical risks. Southeast and
South Asia have emerged as significant relocation centres in response to rising
tariffs and intensified trade barriers between China and Western countries.
Chinese firms recognise that the developing nations in South and Southeast Asia
possess adaptable tariff regulations when engaging with the US and Western
markets. In the same scenario, Chinese FDI in Mexico reached a 13-year high in
2023, with capital expenditure surging to $5.6 billion, up significantly from $267
million in 2018. This ""near-shoring"" move was intended to exploit benefits of
exporting goods to the US produced in Mexico under the USMCA agreement.
Moreover, in the context of China's recent five-year plans, it is evident that the
country is strategically shifting its focus from its previous role as the ""world's
factory,"" which was characterised by the production of low-cost, low-tech goods
supported by competitive labour costs and supply chain efficiencies. China's new
industrial policy of ""Made in China 2025"" aims to enhance the manufacturing
capabilities of Chinese industries, transitioning from labour-intensive operations
to a more technology-driven, sophisticated industrial hub. The focus on high-tech
productive forces, including electric vehicles (EVs), artificial intelligence (AI), and
cutting-edge semiconductors, is expediting the relocation as well.
Bangladesh as a potential destination
Bangladesh has always been a viable destination for Chinese firms as it offers
some significant benefits that Chinese companies enjoy at home. Till date,
Bangladesh can offer the most competitive wages compared to other viable
destinations in the region. The average monthly wage of an industrial worker still
remains below $150 that makes it lucrative for manufacturing industries.
Additionally, the young labour force in Bangladesh presents a significant long-
term benefit for industrial production. The country boasts a demographic
dividend where more than 65 percent of its population is under 35 years old.
Moreover, the geographical location of Bangladesh in the crossroad of the Indo-
Pacific region makes it a suitable transportation and logistical hub for
international shipping of produced goods. As of present circumstances,
Bangladesh can offer duty-free access to European markets as well with zero
tariffs on EBA (Everything but Arms) scheme and curtailed tariffs on goods
exported to the US, Japan, Australia and other countries. Bangladesh also offers
dedicated Export Processing Zones (EPZs) and Special Economic Zones (SEZs) for
attracting FDI, especially in the coastal region.
Chinese industries relocating matter for Bangladesh
The Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) has established a structured
timeline aimed at operationalising five economic zones within the next two years,
out of a total of 100 proposed zones all over Bangladesh. These zones are vital for
attracting FDI from Chinese firms aiming to relocate their operations. It is
noteworthy that China holds the second position after Bangladesh; 108
companies have invested in EPZs. According to data from the Bangladesh Bank,
FDI inflows reached $1.46 billion in FY2023-24, with $424 million of this total
attributed to investments in the export processing zones. Ashraful Kabir, who
serves as a member for investment promotion at BEZA, highlighted that in
addition to RMG products and accessories, 48 percent of the products
manufactured in the EPZs have now diversified into other categories. He noted
that decreasing dependency on RMG production allows the EPZs to enhance
Bangladesh's economic stability by promoting product diversification and
expanding export opportunities. Chinese firms invested $283 million in FY2023-
24, and China is the third largest FDI source for Bangladesh that stands with $1.56
billion in total as of June 2024.

Geopolitics in the age of Trump: Have we been here
before?
It is worth noting that the growth in the manufacturing sector has been sluggish
compared to the service sector. In 2013, the number of economic units of the
industrial sector was 9.2 million, which increased to 1.04 million in 2024. The
growth rate has increased by 15.38 percent in a decade. The slow rate of pace in
Bangladesh's economy does not end here; the number of unemployed people in
the country has increased to 2.66 million, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics (BBS) for the period of July-September 2024. Bangladesh must feel the
urge to attract Chinese industries to invest and increase FDI to overcome this
stagnation. The head of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) International
Department, Liu Jianchau, said to Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Adviser M Touhid
Hossain during his recent visit that China is thinking of relocating its industries
and they are considering Bangladesh as an option. They also think that exporting
the manufactured goods to other countries from Bangladesh and the matter of
incentives in exports will be beneficial to China.
Challenges ahead
However, the existing infrastructure presents significant challenges with shortage
of energy and port delays contributing to increased expenses and diminished
investor trust. The government has initiated large-scale EEZs; however, the pace
of project implementation is not satisfactory. It is an undeniable fact that
Bangladesh has administrative inefficiency and bureaucratic complexities in
attracting foreign investment, which introduces an additional layer of complexity.
Policy reforms are needed now to attract Chinese investment despite advantages.
Tax concessions, tax holiday, and ease of doing business should be prioritised to
attract relocating industries. Bangladesh has a shortage of skilled labour force to
propel newly relocated industries. It will continue to be a significant area of
concern if no comprehensive action plan from the government is taken.
Foreign investors endure significant challenges in Bangladesh due to intricate,
often bureaucratic, approval procedures from various government agencies that
must be fixed to harness relocating Chinese industries. Regional competitors like
Vietnam and Indonesia have already streamlined their investment frameworks to
facilitate the relocation of Chinese industries. Should Bangladesh not implement
necessary reforms to its regulatory framework and expedite investment
processes, it may face significant challenges in maintaining its competitive edge
in international trade.

Bangladesh is not willing to purchase arms under the proposed Indo Pacific Strategy
alliance, led by the United States, the foreign minister said on Monday.
Rather, he added, the country wants American investments in the country's infrastructure.
""They want to sell arms, but we are not interested in issues related to conflict,"" the minister,
AK Abdul Momen, told The FE when asked about Bangladesh's stance on the Indo Pacific
Strategy.
This message will be conveyed to the US deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegan as he
kicks off his three-day Dhaka visit on Wednesday.
Bangladesh feels that the Indo Pacific Strategy will be effective for the country if it gets US
investments in infrastructure building under it.
""We have no objection to the Indo Pacific Strategy. But they should come forward to the
infrastructure development if they want to make the Indo Pacific Strategy more effective"".
""They have to spend money, only talking will not do, they have to invest,"" the minister said
pointing out that the US has no contribution to Bangladesh's infrastructure development.
""They can do it if they want,"" he said defending his argument.
A recent move by the US to sell sophisticated defence equipment, including Apache
helicopters, could not be materialised. US officials admitted that they had several rounds ofBN

which they claimed are the 'best in the world'.
According to a recent study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China
is the fifth biggest arms supplier in the world and also supplies most weapons to the region,
except India, its regional rival
Around 35 per cent of China's arms supplies went to Pakistan between 2013 and 2017,
followed by 19 per cent to Bangladesh.
Dhaka procured 71 per cent of its arms from China over the five-year period, and Myanmar
68 per cent.
In view of the growing influence of China in the region, the US and its allies launched the
Indo Pacific Strategy, apparently to counter China's Belt and Rod Initiative (BRI).
Bangladesh has already become a major partner of BRI under which it will get over US$25
billion for building infrastructure.
Recently, the USA has unleashed a fresh diplomatic offensive to revamp its ties with the
regional countries, which have become partners of the China-led BRI.
Meanwhile, the visit of the US deputy secretary of state is considered to be part of that
effort, analysts said.
Asked about possible agenda, the minister admitted that the Indo Pacific Strategy will be a
major focus in the talks between Bangladeshi officials and Mr Biegun.
However, issues related to Rohingya, visa and Covid cooperation will also come up, he
added.
""We'll discuss the Rohingya issue and we will make it clear that we are not interested in
only humanitarian assistance, our main goal is repatriation, they must go back to that
country,"" the minister said.
Dr Momen criticised the US for not issuing visas to some Bangladeshi students, who
secured I-20 from American institutions.
""They have not issued visas to Bangladeshi students who got I-20, but students of the
neighbouring countries like India and Pakistan got the same category visas. This is
discriminatory,"" he noted.
This is very discriminatory because Bangladesh's condition is better than other nations in
terms of Covid control, impact is much lesser in the country, he argued.
""Still, they did not issue visas to our students, this is not good,"" he said.
""We also want support for our garment sector, which was affected by Covid,"" the minister
said.
For example, the US can offer the garments sector three years' moratorium on duty to
enable the country to absorb shocks from Covid, he added.

in full swing to meet the high demands.
State owned company “China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation” is headquartered in
Beijing’s Xicheng district. 
The company is printing money for other countries on massive scale with more than 18,000
employees, and, it has more than 10 strictly guarded facilities for the production of paper notes
and coins.
According to Liu Guisheng, Chairman of China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation
China first attained international order to print money from Nepal in 2013.  
China won the bids of NPR100, NPR1000 and NPR5 from Nepal, Liu wrote in an article
published in China Finance. 
China also produced a total of 200 million in NPR1000 notes last year. Most of the orders come
from the countries which signed for Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project.
Chinese President Xi Jinping launched the BRI in 2003, which  is a global development blueprint
involving 60 countries from Asia, Europe and Africa to fuel up economic growth through capital
investments and infrastructure projects. 
So far China has won contracts for money production projects from countries from different parts
of the world including Bangladesh, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, India, Brazil and Poland.
China provides embedded thread, metallic ribbon and colour-shifting ink at a relatively low cost

China-Bangladesh: Strengthening
partnership
Tue May 26, 2015 12:00 AM
Last update on: Mon Jun 1, 2015 12:09 AM
VICE Premier of China, Ms. Liu Yandong, began her three-day long visit to Dhaka
on May 24, 2015 and her visit is expected to end today.  Chinese Premier Li
Keqiang is expected to visit Bangladesh next September to join the programmes
marking 40 years of diplomatic relations between Dhaka and Beijing. 
Bangladesh's pragmatic foreign policy under the Hasina government- with China
and India- is bearing fruits. The Bangladesh Prime Minister's landmark visit to
India in January 2010 created an excellent environment of mutual trust that
sought to lay the foundation to a much more mature, stable and fruitful
relationship with India through a 51-paragraph Joint Statement. Similarly, her
visit to China in March 2010 and subsequently in June 2014 further strengthened
the Bangladesh-China relations, which is closer than ever before.  
China has assisted Bangladesh in multi-faceted directions, providing aid in
infrastructure, power, industrial plant and telecommunications. Over the past
few years, China has replaced India as Bangladesh's biggest import source with
bilateral trade of about $10.6 billion in 2014, heavily in favour of China.
China has already assisted in building six bridges in Bangladesh. All the bridges
have contributed to the accelerated socio-economic growth in the country. The
China Major Bridge Engineering Company (CMBEC) is constructing the Padma
multi-purpose bridge, the country's largest-ever infrastructure project, which is
estimated to cost about $1.77 billion or more. China has also shown its interest in
constructing a deep sea port at Sonadia in Chittagong as well as Payra in
Patuakhali.
The government of Bangladesh reportedly sought Chinese soft loans spanning 20
years for 14 infrastructure projects. The important projects include a rail bridge
over the Jamuna River and a high-speed ""chord"" train line between Dhaka and
Comilla. Another project envisaged under the loan is the construction of a 4.8km
long dual-gauge double-track rail bridge parallel to the Bangabandhu Jamuna
Bridge. 
Furthermore, during the visit of the Chinese Foreign Minister to Bangladesh in
December 2014, China reportedly agreed to invest about $4 billion on six projects
which include among others, a tunnel of multiple lanes under the Karnaphuli
river, a second railway bridge on the Karnaphuli river at Kalurghat, construction
of double gauge railway from Chittagong to Cox's Bazar via Ramu and from Ramu
to Gundhum. 
The Hasina government has been a strong believer in regional connectivity, and
given the friendly relations with China and India, the economic corridor among
Bangladesh, India, China and Myanmar (BCIM) will come into existence. In
December 2014, the representatives of the four nations, at a meeting in Cox's
Bazaar decided to create a fund, a substantial part of which may come from
various multilateral development partners while the rest might be borne by the
four governments and the private sector. 
China is also an important supplier of arms and weapons to Bangladesh.
Reportedly, Bangladesh and China signed an agreement in December 2013 to buy
two ""Ming"" class submarines at the cost of $230 million to protect its maritime
areas in the Bay of Bengal. Since 2010, the government has taken firm steps in
gradually building the Bangladesh Navy as a deterrent force and the acquisition
of submarines is a part of the plan to defend its off-shore areas.  
During Yandong's visit, future cooperation with China may be explored in the
following areas among others:  reduction of trade deficit, investment, ICT,
renewable energy, a shifting of low-end industries, such as garments and leather,
to Bangladesh from China, and water resource management of the Brahmaputra
River through a Himalayan Commission consisting of China, India and
Bangladesh, since China built a dam in Tibet on the upper stream of the
Brahmaputra River.
Bangladesh has been able to maintain a balanced relationship with China and
India because the country needs both the economic giants of Asia to quicken its
pace of economic and social development. Furthermore, many analysts believe
that friendly relations with China and India will enable Bangladesh to have more
negotiating leverage regionally and globally.

Bangladesh counterpart Dr AK Abdul Momen has prescheduled engagement abroad at that time.
Dhaka expects that the Chinese side will find alternative dates for the visit which will be
convenient to both sides.
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming met Foreign Minister Momen on Sunday at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and discussed various issues of mutual interest including the
proposed visit of the Chinese Foreign Minister. 
Minister Wang is a member of the 19th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,

Every time a senior Chinese leader meets a new batch of foreign journalists, he or she invariably
encounters a question – what are the secrets of the development miracle of the growing economic
superpower? Such questions cropping up in anyone's mind is absolutely rational. The development of the
country , which revolved around its economic uplift, has stunned the entire world. Modern China has shown
the world that it is not that impossible to attain around 10 percent average GDP  growth for three long
decades at a stretch [China posted average annual GDP  growth of 9.91 percent from 1979 until 2010]. The
country's gradually turning to the production hub for the world has facilitated such a colossal growth for
which the credit goes to its industrious law-abiding people, and most importantly to the ruling Communist
Party of China (CPC), which steered the nation to the present position.
There is no denying that the destiny of today's China was written a century ago on Jul 1, 1921 with the
foundation of the CPC in the Red Boat on the South Lake in Jiaxing in Zhejiang province. Twenty-eight
years later , the party took control of the country and founded the People's Republic of China. Immediately
after the takeover , the party under the leadership of Mao Zedong launched a campaign to integrate the
womenfolk into the mainstream economy . His unforgettable statement – ""in China, women hold half of the
sky"" – still inspires many in the world. And the ef forts of the Chinese leaders have paid of f; China has
secured a gender balance unmatched by any other country of the world with women holding jobs spanning
from long-haul truck-driving to the top position in state agencies. It is hard to find any woman in China
passing her days by doing only household chores or rearing children; everyone is contributing to the
economy directly .Updated :  01 Jul 2021, 04:48 PM

https://bdnews24.com/opinion/long-march-from-red-boat 2/8The long ef forts have earned China the status of the second-largest economy in the world and leading the
nation to be the largest one, beating the United States. Global agencies and economists have forecast the
Chinese economy will surpass the United States' in 2030, but it will be no wonder if the country attains the
status well before that time.
Now China has been in the top position in many fields, particularly manufacturing sectors. Let's look at a
few sectors. Having almost no significant manufacturing facilities in the electronics sector only four decades
ago, the country has now been the largest electronics manufacturer , accounting for $600 billion of the $2.5
trillion global electronics market. No country in the world — be it highly regulated or unregulated — can
imagine its electronics market without the made-in-China products. And beginning its automobile industry in
the 50s of the last century with the production of only commercial vehicles, the country boasts of the largest
automotive industry since 2008 in terms of the production of automobile units. According to
www .statista.com, China's annual production since 2009 has exceeded the combined production of two old
car-making nations – the United States and Japan. In 2020, for example, over 25 million units or 28 percent
of the world's cars were manufactured in China. The rise of the Chinese car-making industry has started
reshaping the Bangladesh market too where people would prefer reconditioned Japanese vehicles to brand
new Chinese cars just several years ago. The situation has changed a lot; several Chinese brands are
grabbing the Bangladesh market faster than any other new brands.
China's development has not remained confined only to economics; all other fields, spanning from
education to human quality , from military power to space science, have witnessed the development. Its
success in space programmes, as a new member of the elite space club, has surprised the whole world.
Beginning its space programmes through the first crewed space programme just 18 years ago in 2003,
when an accelerated programme of technological development culminated in Yang Liwei's successful 2003×

and crewed expeditions to the Moon and interplanetary missions to explore the solar system and beyond.
The country has articulated long-term ambitions to exploit earth-moon space for industrial development.
The Chinese happen to be a civilised and disciplined nation since the ancient period. But the more the
country has developed, the more its nationals have been disciplined. During my days in Beijing when I was
working with China Radio International, there was an agreement among the foreign journalists in the radio
station – no matter which country they are from – that any nation in the world can envy China in compliance
with laws. You will hardly find any Chinese who tries to breach the law or norms of society , even if he or she
is out of the reach of the law enforcement authorities. Such respect for the law has made the Chinese one
of the most disciplined nations.
Envious of the forward march of China, several influential states have left no stone unturned to hold the
country back, but to no avail. The barriers are making the country even stronger . Now it is hard for anyone
to imagine where China will reach 50 or 100 years later if the forward march continues.
The present leadership of China, however , does not want to move forward alone; they want to have other
nations by them in the unhampered march and are working for the development of mankind. The phrase
""The Community with a Shared Future for Mankind"" was included in the preamble of the Constitution of
China in 2018, manifesting the Chinese leaders' aim to build a global society with common development.
Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also the general secretary of the CPC, often cites the phrase. The
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in which China is investing billions of dollars to develop communication
infrastructure across continents, will push forward the common development as envisaged by the Chinese
leadership.×

https://www.dhakatribune.com/magazine/arts-and-letters/352890/debunking-the-myth-of-bri-s-‘debt-trap’ 1/5One of the most talked about aspects of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is its so-called ""debt
trap."" Many claim that China is establishing political and economic control over developing
countries by trapping them in debt through the BRI project. On the other hand, some experts
think this is a myth and the claim has no basis in actual evidence. The book, The Reality and
Myth of BRI's 'Debt Trap': Evidences from Asia and Africa,   focuses on this debate. Edited by
Nian Peng and Ming Yu Cheng, and published by Springer Nature, the book consists of 12
chapters presenting various aspects of BRI projects and country-based evidence regarding its debt
trap. 
The first chapter discusses the history of BRI and its main objectives. The BRI is a global
development strategy launched by President Xi Jinping in 2013. Its main objective is to revive
the ancient Silk Road and connect the various countries through modern rail, road, and sea
routes. 
The second chapter contains misconceptions of BRI's “debt trap” -- the Chinese perspective.
China claims that BRI projects do not create debt traps but help developing countries prosper
economically. 
The third chapter analyzes the Debt Trap Theory: The Logic of Power Politics in India. This
chapter explains the BRI's “debt trap” theory from India's perspective. India feels China is trying
to increase its influence in South Asia through the BRI project. 
The fourth chapter explains debt problems in Myanmar and BRI-CMEC. BRI and CMEC
projects are analyzed in Myanmar's context. It discusses how BRI projects have created or solved

development in the context of the BRI in Africa. The impact of BRI projects in Africa is
discussed. In particular, the economic impact of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) project and
its role in Africa's development are analyzed. 
BRI projects mainly work as a facilitator for infrastructure development in developing countries.
China is implementing railway, road, port, and other infrastructure development projects in
various countries through these projects. The main objective of BRI projects is to increase trade
connectivity and accelerate financial development. However, allegations of a “debt trap” arose
against BRI projects. Critics say China deliberately lends large sums of debt to developing
countries and seizes the country's vital assets when they default. Various studies and evidence are
presented in this book to support these allegations. 
The infrastructure of various countries is being improved through BRI projects. New railways,
roads, ports, and other infrastructure are being built, which help the economic development of
countries. Trade connectivity between countries is increasing through BRI projects. As a result,
the country's economy is becoming dynamic, and international trade opportunities are increasing.
The economic development of countries is being accelerated through BRI projects. New job
opportunities are being created, and people's incomes are increasing. 
The debt burden on the country is increasing through BRI projects. Many countries have trouble
repaying these debts and suffer from economic crises. China's political influence is increasing
through BRI projects. China's control over developing countries is increasing, and their
independence is diminishing. BRI projects are hurting the environment. Creating new
infrastructure is causing deforestation, water pollution, and other environmental problems. 
The book, The Reality and Myth of BRI's “Debt Trap”: Evidences from Asia and Africa,   clearly
explains BRI's “debt trap” reality and myth. This book shows that BRI projects help the
infrastructural development of developing countries but also increase the risk of debt and political
influence. This book provides readers with an in-depth understanding of the prospects and
challenges of BRI projects, which is crucial for readers interested in the subject. This book
review provides a clear idea of the realities and myths of BRI projects. It discusses the prospects
and challenges of BRI projects, which are of great value to the readers.

x25/05/2025, 15:14 BNP looks to China
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/342864/bnp-looks-to-china 1/6Although the BNP highlights voters’ “massive non-participation” in the January 7 elections as a
“political victory,"" in reality, the party is embattled by internal criticisms on various issues and is
poised to modify its strategies. The latest subject of this discussion is the party's foreign policy,
which includes the politicization of the anti-India campaign on social media and the formulation
of regional strategy papers.
BNP's Foreign Relations Committee (FRC) and Standing Committee members said there is a
discussion of giving importance to China. The top leadership has decided to seriously consider
the issue of re-establishing contact with China and has assigned a senior leader to take the
process forward. However, gathering detailed information about this was not possible.
Several members of the Foreign Affairs Committee said there is a difference between program
and policy. Recently, many people have viewed the issue of anti-Indian sentiment as a party
policy, but the BNP has shown no concern for it. Social exclusion of Indian products is related to
political programs. In this case, it will not be correct to combine the issue with the policies. The
main policy of the party is based on General Ziaur Rahman's foreign policy, and it will continue
like that.
The Standing Committee meeting on Monday largely avoided discussing the India issue. ""There
is now a personal ideological battle going on in the BNP on the issue of India. It will not benefit
the party,” a senior leader said, asking not to be named.
BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told Bangla Tribune: ""I will not say
anything about it now.""
x25/05/2025, 15:14 BNP looks to China
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/342864/bnp-looks-to-china 2/6Several leaders involved in the Foreign Relations Committee said that after the election on
January 7, the top leadership of the party is eager to restore momentum in the party. The
committee is also involved in this activity.
Meanwhile, acting chairman Tarique Rahman has started discussions with the committee
members. In this case, there is no change in the leadership of the committee. These leaders said
Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury will remain the head of the committee. The top leadership is
taking into consideration the issue of new members, a new strategy, the regional desk, regular
meetings, and reviews.
They said Tarique Rahman is talking to the members of the committee separately, considering
there was an opportunity to improve in the previous elections to determine the political strategy
of the future. Several members have already submitted their views on the party's future
international relations to him. Some gave their opinion in writing, some verbally.
However, a leader claimed that some members of the Standing Committee had started efforts to
make the Foreign Relations Committee a failure. Amir Khosru was arrested on October 29.
Before his arrest, he held meetings with the foreign embassy officials together with Mirza
Fakhrul and Organizing Secretary Shama Obaid.
Ahead of the January 7 election, the race between the BNP and other political parties in the
diplomatic quarter was eye-catching. After the announcement of the US visa policy, some leaders
of the Awami League, BNP, and Jatiya Party held meetings at the residence of US Ambassador
Peter Haas in Dhaka on May 25 last year. BNP leaders Amir Khosru and Shama Obaid were
there.
On July 11-14 of the outgoing year, a four-member delegation, including Uzra Zeya, Assistant
Secretary of the US State Department, and Donald Lu, Assistant Secretary for South and Central
Asian Affairs, visited Dhaka. They did not hold any meetings with any political party. However,
Donald Lu called on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who promised to hold “free, fair, and
acceptable elections.”
BNP leader Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan held a meeting with the US ambassador after the election.
Standing committee members Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku and Salahuddin Ahmed joined various
efforts in Delhi during the pre-election movement.
Before the election, the most talked-about was a meeting of Mirza Fakhrul with US Ambassador
Peter Haas in Dhaka on October 12. However, the “one-to-one” meeting was not acknowledged
by Mirza Fakhrul.
x25/05/2025, 15:14 BNP looks to China
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/342864/bnp-looks-to-china 3/6After being released from prison on February 15 this year, Mirza Fakhrul, Amir Khosru, and
Shama Obaid met with Afrin Akhtar, Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia of
the Department of State, who was visiting Dhaka on February 24.
""The Standing Committee discussed the messages given by friendly countries in the pre-election
meetings and what actually happened. The issue of renewing international relations also came
up,” said a senior leader.
“In terms of regional policy, India and China came up for discussion; there is no need to mention
Pakistan. But there is a problem. The BNP announced its Indo-Pacific strategy paper on October
23 last year. But it has yet to clear its position regarding China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
The BNP says: “Our Indo-Pacific vision reflects the desires of the people by prioritizing their
interests and aspirations. We pledge to align economically and strategically with democratic
nations and institutions and implement domestic initiatives to empower all Bangladeshis with
freedom, equality, and prosperity, irrespective of gender, religion, ethnicity, or politics. Our party
is dedicated to ensuring a secure and stable Indo-Pacific region while protecting our national
interests and contributing to collective security.”
Asked about this, Amir Khosru said: ""We have no distance with anyone. The government
maintains bilateral relationships with other governments. I do not see any distance between BNP
and China. Now the Awami League is in power, so the Chinese government is working with
them. The BNP will work with them when in power. There will be no exception.”
Some leaders of the BNP have raised the question of whether there will be any conflict if the
party chooses to join both the BRI and the Indo-Pacific Strategy. The ruling Awami League is
associated with both initiatives; the government formulated the Indo-Pacific Outlook last year
and joined the BRI in 2016.
In October of that year, Bangladesh signed the agreement in the presence of Chinese President Xi
Jinping, who was visiting Dhaka. Incidentally, the Chinese president also met BNP Chairperson
Khaleda Zia and discussed Silk Road.
When asked, Organizing Secretary Shama Obaid said: ""The BNP is a political party, a party in
favour of maintaining good relations with everyone. In my opinion, not just China, we should
have friendly relations with all superpowers—India, the EU, Russia, Scandinavian countries,
Asean countries, and countries in the South Asia region. It matters both ways, whether we are in
the opposition party or the government party.”
x25/05/2025, 15:14 BNP looks to China
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/342864/bnp-looks-to-china 4/6She added: ""Former President Ziaur Rahman believed in good relations with everyone while
maintaining the interests of the country. I also think that this is how BNP's diplomacy should be.
“In this case, the interests of the country must be prioritized first. The people of our country are
now angry with India because people think that the Awami League has been in power for the last
15 years through oppression and torture...the Awami League leaders are constantly saying this.
This is why the anti-India sentiment has been created. It is a natural reaction.”
BNP’s sincere relationship with China began in 1976. China came forward because of the
initiative of the then president of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman. Prof Dr Tareque Samsur Rahman,
the late teacher of Jahangirnagar University, wrote in the article titled “Foreign Policy of Four
Decades” that Zia contributed the most to the question of developing relations with China. “He
not only increased relations but also made China's presence in Bangladesh's foreign policy
necessary. The significant aspect of Begum Zia's foreign policy (in 1991-96, and 2001-2006) was
to give importance to relations with China.""
However, during the BNP-Jamaat coalition government in 2004, the relationship between the
BNP and China deteriorated after Taiwan's consulate was opened in Dhaka. After the meeting
between the Chinese president and the BNP chief in 2016, Mirza Fakhrul told reporters that
Khaleda Zia hoped that China would stand by Bangladesh in terms of development.
Abdul Moyeen Khan, a member of the Standing Committee, led an 11-member BNP delegation
to China in September 2014. The other members included Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, Nazrul Islam
Khan, and Ruhul Kabir Rizvi Ahmed. The following year, an Awami League delegation visited
China, but the BNP did not receive an invitation.
Before the 2018 election, three leaders of the BNP went to the invitation of the Chinese
government again. The delegation was led by then-BNP Vice Chairman Iqbal Hasan Mahmud
Tuku. Currently, he is a member of the Standing Committee and the FRC.
The Chinese Embassy in Dhaka sent gifts to BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia on her birthday in
2020.
Disputes with China arose again in 2021. The BNP made a statement on December 11 of that
year in light of a video speech by the Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh.
""What measures China will maintain in its own country is entirely its internal matter,"" Rizvi's
statement read. But the people of Bangladesh have traditionally exercised and will exercise their
state ownership through the exercise of free elections and direct voting. Direct voting is the

lifeblood of democracy and the only means of exercising people's power, through which the state
is accountable to the people. This is the universal way of practicing democracy, recognized
globally and by the United Nations.
“Therefore, for the sake of free elections, human rights, democracy, and friendship among the
people of two friendly countries, the BNP and countrymen's expectation towards China is that
they will always stand by the side of the people who are the real owners of the country, not this
illegal government that is anti-people and isolated.”
Clear difference among BNP
leaders surfaces
 
Since this statement, the relationship has not improved much. Meanwhile, a few cartons of gifts
were sent to the BNP chairperson's office, but through courier services, on June 23, 2023.
According to Barrister Naushad Zamir, the international affairs secretary of the BNP, the party
believes in the “One China Principle,” while the Awami League believes in the “One China
Policy.” Ziaur Rahman also believed in the “One China Principle,” which is why BNP is
important to China.

In Monday’s section, Ambassador Li discusses the alignment of China’s Belt and Road Initiative
with Bangladesh’s Vision 2041 and the role China plays in Bangladesh’s development
How will China str engthen the alignment of its Belt
and Road Initiative with Bangladesh’ s Vision 2041 in
near  futur e? How many development pr ojects in
Bangladesh ar e funded by China? What ar e the key
projects?
Bangladesh’s Vision 2041 perspective plan provides road-map for accelerating growth and lays
down broad approaches for eradication of poverty, inequality, and human deprivation. By
implementing the plan, Bangladesh is expected to make rapid change in agriculture, trade and
industry, education, health care, transportation and communication, etc.
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the right venue for tangible and intangible outcomes pertinent to
innovative, harmonized, green, open, high-quality and shared developments, which protects and
maintains peace and promotes people's well-being in the post COVID-19 era. 
BRI is proposed by China, but not owned exclusively by China. Ever since its genesis, BRI has
been aiming at integrating with development strategies of all parties interested. Bangladesh is one
of the first countries to respond to BRI and an important participant thereof. By far, Bangladesh
has become one of the countries with most cooperation and fruitful results under the BRI
framework.
Also Read: ‘Belt and Road Initiative and Vision 2041 to integrate further’
As strategic partners of cooperation, it is natural for Bangladesh and China to coordinate and
integrate development strategies. We have established the Joint Economic and Trade Committee
as an institutional arrangement for economic and trade cooperation. 
x25/05/2025, 14:46 ‘By far, Bangladesh has become one of the countries with most cooperation and fruitful results under the BRI framework’
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/293097/‘by-far-bangladesh-has-become-one-of-the 2/4According to data from China, the bilateral trade between China and Bangladesh increased
significantly in 2021, exceeding 25 billion US dollars. The turnover of China's contracted
projects to Bangladesh remained in the forefront of South Asian countries, and China's
investment in Bangladesh increased by more than 290% year-on-year.
To further enhance integration of development strategies, the two sides could work together in the
following aspects:
First, we need to further strengthen political mutual trust, consolidate the foundation for win-win
results, enhance risk management and control, and secure the cooperation environment against
the rapidly changing international situation.
Second, we need to further enhance inter-governmental cooperation and promote the
implementation of major projects. After Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Bangladesh in
2016, a series of major projects have been progressing smoothly and are expected to be
completed by the end of 2024. 
Third, we need to fully utilize the high-quality projects and expand the volume of cooperation,
such as the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center, the zero-tariff treatment for 98% of
Bangladeshi products exported to China, and the large-scale international exhibitions like the
China International Import Expo and the Canton Fair.
Fourth, we need to explore new opportunities and cultivate new growth points. Specifically, we
can promote PPP cooperation, advance studies on bilateral FTA, jointly respond to pandemic and
climate change, restore rivers, develop green and low-carbon energies, and work on digital
economy.

Kazi Anis Ahmed, PublisherIn recent years, China has achieved leapfrog development in renewable energy. The installed
scale of hydropower, wind power, photovoltaic power and biomass power has been the world's
largest for 17 years, 12 years, 7 years, and 4 years respectively. 
China and Bangladesh have broad scope for cooperation and development in the field of
renewable energy. Against the backdrop of the global response to climate change and accelerated
energy transition, it is necessary for China and Bangladesh to strengthen cooperation on global
energy governance, promote healthy development of global energy governance system, and make
positive contributions to the response to climate change.

হামেপজIndia has significantly reduced the number of medical visas issued to
Bangladeshis despite repeated requests from Dhaka.
This move has created an opportunity for China to expand its
influence, as it actively promotes medical tourism for Bangladeshis.
According to six anonymous officials, the decline in visa issuance is
a result of strained bilateral relations and a shortage of personnel,
Reuters reports. 
In 2023, India issued over 2 million medical visas to Bangladeshis,
making healthcare one of the primary reasons for travel between the
two neighbouring countries.
Bangladeshis preferred Indian hospitals due to their affordability and
the presence of Bangla-speaking medical staff.
Previously, India issued between 5,000 to 7,000 medical visas per
day, but following Bangladesh’s political transition last August, that
number has now dropped to fewer than 1,000 per day.
China has swiftly capitalized on this gap by promoting its healthcare
sector as an alternative.
Recently, several Bangladeshis travelled to China’s Yunnan province
for medical treatment.
Chinese Ambassador Yao Wen remarked that this visit marks the
beginning of medical tourism cooperation between the two nations.
China is not only strengthening medical ties but also increasing
economic investments in Bangladesh.
Wen noted that since the interim government assumed office, at least
14 Chinese companies have invested $230 million in the country.
Over the past seven months, China has emerged as the largest foreign
investor in Bangladesh.
Additionally, a spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Foreign
Affairs reaffirmed Beijing’s commitment to deepening cooperative
relations with Bangladesh.Police

Yunus’s China visit can open many doors
Wed Mar 26, 2025 05:28 PM
Last update on: Wed Mar 26, 2025 08:03 PM
Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus's tour to China marks a pivotal moment in
Bangladesh-China bilateral relations, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of
diplomatic ties between the two countries. China is currently Bangladesh's largest
trading and defence partner, reflecting the robust and multifaceted nature of
their bilateral ties.
FILE VISUAl: Anwar Sohel
According to Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen, the chief adviser's visit
is expected to be ""successful"" and ""productive,"" with ""some announcements""
anticipated. While the specifics of these announcements remain unclear,
Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Adviser M Touhid Hossain has indicated that the visit
is unlikely to result in any formal agreements. However, several memoranda of
understanding (MoUs)—non-binding but formal agreements—may be signed. This
visit is expected to serve as a foundation for the recalibration of Bangladesh-
China relations. Therefore, some areas require focused attention and action to
yield tangible outcomes.
Although China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner, Bangladeshi exports to
China remain low. In the last fiscal year, the trade deficit marginally increased by
over one percent, reaching $16.45 billion. While China has granted 100 percent
duty-free access for Bangladeshi products, this has not translated into a
significant increase in exports due to a limited range of exportable goods,
stringent value addition requirements, and a lack of competitiveness in key
sectors.

Yunus’ China tour: Trade and investment top priority
Yunus's visit should prioritise strategies to diversify Bangladesh's exports to China
and improve market access for Bangladeshi goods. In this regard, the Bangladesh
Embassy to China can play a proactive role by organising exhibitions of
Bangladeshi products in major Chinese cities to attract local consumers and
businesses.
Regarding investments, China has made substantial contributions to Bangladesh's
infrastructure and energy sectors through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
However, there remains potential to attract more investments, particularly in
high-end manufacturing industries. The chief adviser's visit could facilitate
discussions on encouraging Chinese companies to relocate their factories to
Bangladesh—particularly the Chinese sunset industries. As China faces
increasing trade barriers on the global stage, the sunset companies can bypass
restrictions in Bangladesh while creating jobs and fostering industrial growth
here.
The interim government of Bangladesh has also been negotiating with China to
reduce the interest rates on existing loans from two to three percent to one
percent and to extend the repayment period from 20 to 30 years. If successful,
these adjustments would provide significant relief to Bangladesh's forex reserves
and alleviate pressure on the economy.
The chief adviser's visit could also provide an opportunity to strengthen
cooperation in the defence sector by exploring possibilities for defence
technology transfer and the establishment of joint manufacturing capabilities.
This would boost Bangladesh's domestic defence industry and enhance its
military capabilities.

Affordable and high-quality healthcare remains limited in Bangladesh. China can
take the opportunity to invest in Bangladesh's healthcare sector by building
specialised hospital chains, training medical professionals, and providing
advanced medical technologies. It can also position itself as an alternative
destination for medical treatment by easing visa policies for Bangladeshi patients
and reducing flight costs.
Another key area that warrants attention during the visit is the Teesta River
Comprehensive Management Project. China remains willing to engage in the
project, and this visit provides an opportunity for Bangladesh to further analyse
the prospect of China contributing to the management of the river, which may
benefit both countries.
The Rohingya refugee crisis continues to be one of Bangladesh's most pressing
diplomatic challenges, with more than 1.2 million refugees living at the refugee
camps in Cox's Bazar. The international community has largely sidelined the
crisis, and humanitarian assistance has been reduced.
Given China's significant influence over Myanmar, it could play a crucial role in
mediating the repatriation process. The ongoing control of the Arakan Army in
most of Rakhine state presents an opportunity for China to leverage its influence
over the group to help resolve the crisis. The chief adviser's China tour could
mark a significant step in facilitating a peaceful solution to the Rohingya issue,
further consolidating China's position as a key diplomatic player in the region.

Yunus' China visit to be 'very productive': envoy
However, this visit also brings challenges, and Bangladesh must navigate a
delicate balancing act in its foreign policy decisions. While fostering closer ties
with China, Bangladesh must retain its strategic autonomy and avoid becoming a
pawn in larger geopolitical games by pursuing policies that align with national
interests.

Annual turnover peaks on huge capital goods imports

Economic ties between Bangladesh and China have deepened significantly, with
Bangladeshʼs imports from the worldʼs second-largest economy continuing to grow despite
ongoing import restrictions—largely thanks to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).BN
25/05/2025, 11:39 Annual turnover peaks on huge capital goods imports | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/annual-turnover-peaks-on-huge-capital-goods-imports 1/10This trade expansion has strengthened the countryʼs export capabilities and contributed to
its overall economic growth.
Introduced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, the BRI saw Bangladesh join in 2016,
initiating an era of enhanced bilateral trade, according to economists.
During President Xiʼs visit to Bangladesh in 2016, he pledged US$40 billion for a number of
infrastructure projects, further cementing economic collaboration under the BRI
framework.
Trade between the two nations has grown significantly in recent years, with bilateral trade
standing at $11.56 billion in 2018. It rose by 8.53 per cent to $12.54 billion in 2019 and
reached the bilateral relations at $19.3 billion in the fiscal year 2023, according to the
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the national statistical organisation.
Since 2018, China has been Bangladeshʼs largest trading partner, overtaking neighbouring
India, which now ranks second.
Economists acknowledge the substantial trade deficit with China but emphasise the critical
role of Chinese capital goods in supporting the countryʼs economic momentum.
These goods –industrial raw materials—essential for the countryʼs $450 billion economy,
where the industrial sector contributes 23 per cent —fuel growth by enabling export-driven
industries.
Dr. Wahiduddin Mahmud, a prominent economist and professor of economics, highlights
Bangladeshʼs dependence on Chinese imports for raw materials and machinery,
particularly for the export-oriented manufacturing sector.
“Bangladesh depends on industrial raw materials from China to make garments for
exports,” said Professor Wahiduddin Mahmud about import dividends.
Bangladeshʼs primary export markets include the European Union and North America.
Similarly, Dr. M. Masrur Reaz, chairman of Policy Exchange of Bangladesh, a privately-
owned think tank in Bangladesh, argued that the trade deficit with China should not be a
concern, as Chinese goods dominate the Bangladeshi market due to their cost
competitiveness.
Chinese goods dominate the Bangladeshi market due to their competitive prices, especially
in machinery vital for the ready-made garment (RMG) industry.25/05/2025, 11:39 Annual turnover peaks on huge capital goods imports | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/annual-turnover-peaks-on-huge-capital-goods-imports 2/10“If China import grows, it has positive contributions to Bangladesh exports,” Dr. Masrur
added.
Yet, the rapid expansion of its garment industry—employing around 5.0 million workers,
most of them women—has deepened trade ties with China.
Bangladesh, the worldʼs second-largest apparel exporter after China, heavily relies on
Chinese machinery and raw materials.
Bangladesh has been pursuing import restrictions since the beginning of the war in Ukraine
in February in 2022 as its foreign exchange reserves have been depleting rapid.
Syed Nazrul Islam, managing director of Well Dress, a concern of leading conglomerate ---
Well Food Group ---vividly described this dependence: “We canʼt afford not to buy from
China; our entire supply chain would collapse.”
The hum of Chinese-made automatic sewing machines in his factory illustrates how
imported technology drives Bangladeshʼs economic resilience.
Former BGMEA president Anwar Ul Alam Chowdhury highlighted the role of Chinese
machinery in making Bangladeshʼs ready-made garment (RMG) industry more cost-25/05/2025, 11:39 Annual turnover peaks on huge capital goods imports | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/annual-turnover-peaks-on-huge-capital-goods-imports 3/10efficient.
China offers competitive prices, has wide range of products, according to industrialist Mr.
Chowdhury.
“Chinaʼs products are integral to our industry. We cannot imagine operating without them,”
he said.
He pointed out that infrastructure projects under the BRI are enhancing Bangladeshʼs
competitiveness in global trade.
“When oneʼs trading partner improves, it impacts associated economies. We have largely
benefited from China, which is our largest trading partner,” Mr. Chowdhury also managing
director of leading clothing giant –Evince Group---noted.
In the meantime, Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh has surged since
the country joined the BRI.
Over the past decade, Bangladesh has received more than $2.6 billion in FDI from China,
primarily for infrastructure projects such as rail links, power plants, and logistics facilities.
A notable example is Alipayʼs 2018 acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in bKash, Bangladeshʼs
largest mobile financial service provider.
Dr. Zahid Hussain, another leading economist, emphasized the importance of Chinese
imports for Bangladeshʼs growth, particularly in machinery and raw materials critical to
export-driven and domestic industries.25/05/2025, 11:39 Annual turnover peaks on huge capital goods imports | The Financial Express

Our most machinery, raw goods coming from China, according to Dr. Hussain.
He said that the FDI from China is crucial for Bangladesh, as funding for BRI projects from
Chinese banks is more accessible compared to multilateral funding organisations.
Bangladeshʼs imports from China—primarily machinery, electronics, textiles, chemicals,
and industrial inputs—account for 70 per cent of its total imports.
By contrast, its exports to China are limited to jute yarn, leather, and knitwear.
Globally, China maintains trade surpluses with 174 countries, including the United States,
while running deficits with oil-producing nations and countries like Japan and South Korea
that supply electronics and machinery.
Despite Bangladeshʼs trade imbalance with China, the experts contend that the economic
benefits—including job creation, industrial growth, and infrastructure development—
outweigh concerns over the deficit.
Reliance on Chinese capital goods will likely sustain Bangladeshʼs economic resilience in
the years to come.

Yunus urges China to reduce interest
rates
Fri Mar 28, 2025 12:00 AM
Last update on: Fri Mar 28, 2025 12:30 AM
Dhaka has reiterated its call for reducing interest rates for Chinese loans from 3
percent to 1-2 percent, while also seeking a waiver on commitment fees for
Chinese-funded projects.
Photo: Collected
The call was made yesterday during Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus's bilateral
meeting with Chinese Executive Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang on the sidelines of
the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference in Hainan.
In yesterday's meeting, Ding said his country would fund modernisation efforts of
the Mongla Port and the Dasherkandi Sewage project and assured Chinese
funding to purchase four ocean-going vessels for Dhaka's state-run Bangladesh
Shipping Corporation.
In a separate meeting with China's Export-Import Bank Chairman Chen Huaiyu,
Bangladeshi officials sought quick disbursement of Exim Bank's funding and
support in new infrastructure projects such as the Dasherkandi Sewage plant.
They also urged the bank to reduce its commitment fees, which raise project
costs.
Chen said his bank would look into the proposals, but also urged Bangladesh to
consider taking on more concessionary loans in renminbi, the Chinese currency.

Yunus’s China visit can open many doors
Bangladesh had made similar requests when Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain
held a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing in
January.
During that visit, Beijing had agreed in principle to extend the repayment period
for Chinese loans and assured of looking into the request to lower the interest
rate.
Asked if China has taken action towards this end, Foreign Secretary Jashim Uddin
said on Tuesday said that there might be an announcement on the matter after
Yunus's bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.
China is Bangladesh's fourth-largest lender after Japan, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank, with total loans disbursed since 1975 coming to $7.5
billion.
During yesterday's meeting with Chinese Executive Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang,
Yunus sought Chinese support in an array of development and livelihood projects
while offering a site for possible relocation of Chinese manufacturing industries.
He reiterated Bangladesh's firm commitment to the One-China policy and said
Dhaka takes pride in being the first South Asian country to join China's Belt and
Road Initiative.
The two leaders agreed to deepen the bilateral relationship between Bangladesh
and China, with Beijing saying it would extend full support to the interim
government of Bangladesh.
They also agreed to boost investment, trade and cultural ties and people-to-
people exchanges as they mark 50 years since the establishment of their
diplomatic relationships.
""President Xi Jinping attaches tremendous importance to your visit,"" Ding said,
adding that China hopes Bangladesh would prosper and grow under the
leadership of Yunus.
He said Beijing will extend duty-free and quota-free access to Bangladeshi goods
to China until 2028, two years after Bangladesh graduates from the least-
developed country bracket to a middle-income economy. Beijing is also keen to
start free trade negotiations with Dhaka, he said.
China last year signed a protocol to import mango from Bangladesh. The mango
export would begin this summer. Beijing would also import jackfruit, guava and
other aquatic products from Bangladesh in its attempt to minimise trade
imbalance, he said.
Bilateral trade stands at $25 billion at present, but Bangladesh's exports to China
are less than $1 billion.
Ding said the Chinese government and its universities would grant more
scholarships to Bangladeshi students.
He said Beijing would foster dialogue between Bangladesh and Myanmar in an
effort to resolve the Rohingya crisis.
Meanwhile, China's EXIM Bank Chairman Chen said his bank would support the
relocation of Chinese manufacturing plants to Bangladesh to use the country as a
platform for export to other nations.
Bangladesh's strategic location and its human resources can transform the
country into a manufacturing hub for top global companies both from China and
elsewhere in the world, Yunus told Chen.
He said the Bangladesh government would offer attractive benefits for the
manufacturers and provide a trade corridor for the Chinese companies.
""Bangladesh can be complementary to China as far as manufacturing is
concerned,"" Yunus said, adding that the interim government is fast-tracking the
construction of a Chinese Special Economic Zone in the Chattogram region.
The country is also building large new ports to serve not only its economy but
also the landlocked countries of Nepal and Bhutan and India's seven northeastern
states.
Chen said Bangladesh is perfectly located to serve both southeastern and far east
Asia and also the Middle East and Western Asia.
More and more Chinese companies are going global, and his bank would support
their investment in Bangladesh and ""develop manufacturing"" in the country.
The bank would also support building infrastructure in Bangladesh to support
the country's socio-economic and sustainable growth.
Chen said Bangladesh needs to improve its business environment to woo
investors from China.
Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain; Energy, Rail and Road Transport Adviser Fouzul
Kabir Khan; High Representative of the Chief Adviser Khalilur Rahman; and BIDA
Executive Chairman Ashiq Chowdhury were present during the meeting.
Yunus also held meetings with former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; Wu
Xiaoling, former vice president of the Central Bank of China; and Alexei
Overchuk, deputy prime minister of Russia.
He sought support and advice from Ban Ki-moon for a smooth transition to
democracy in Bangladesh.

Yunus’ China tour: Trade and investment top priority
Ban Ki-moon said Bangladesh progressed a lot but should have done better
politically and democratically.
Yunus said Bangladesh recently settled a long-pending land issue with the Korean
EPZ in Chattogram, hoping that it would encourage more Korean business people
to invest in Bangladesh.
BIDA Chairman Ashik Chowdhury informed the meeting that Kihak Sung would
lead a 26-member strong business delegation from Korea in the upcoming
Investment Summit in Dhaka.
He also met China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation President Chen
Sichang and discussed a potential second Chinese economic zone in Mongla of
Bagerhat and potential collaboration to employ Bangladeshi workers across the
globe in CCECC-run projects.
During his meeting with FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu, Yunus urged him to
act as a matchmaker between Chinese importers and Bangladesh farm and fruit
producers.
""We need support in fruit processing and vegetable preservation, storage and
packaging. You can connect China with our farmers and exporters,"" Yunus said.
In response, Qu said FAO would take up a new project to export Bangladeshi farm
products to China.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Wen has said that despite the “steady progress” of Dhaka-Beijing
relations, some “disturbing noises” emerge once in a while.
But there is no use of that as the relationship is “widely endorsed by all walks of life across the
country,"" he said while speaking at the reunion of Bangladeshi participants attending 2023
Chinese government training programs at the embassy on Tuesday night.
The ambassador did not mention specifically what the “disturbing noises"" were, but he mentioned
the China trap issue, which is widely reported by Western media.
“The so-called China trap is sheer fabrication,” he said, adding that the projects carried out by
Beijing under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) would bring about “China benefit.""
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI.
China also comes into the political limelight in Bangladesh for criticizing Western interference in
the upcoming general elections.
The ambassador said China and Bangladesh are “not only traditionally friendly neighbours but
also strategic partners.""

China is also a major source of foreign investment for Bangladesh, with an investment stock of
$3.17 billion and more diversified investment sectors being explored.
Currently, there are around 700 Chinese companies registered in Bangladesh; they have
constructed 7 railways, 12 roads, 21 bridges, and 31 power plants, providing 550,000 job
opportunities, he said.
""2023 is a fruitful year for the Chinese government's training programs in Bangladesh. With the
resumption of physical training programs, we have witnessed a remarkable increase in the
number of participants in China,"" he said, adding that 370 Bangladeshi officials have participated
in this year's training programs.
With that, he said, the Chinese government's training programs in Bangladesh have sent
approximately 5,500 Bangladeshi officials, technical experts, young scholars, and media
representatives to receive training in China, and all the seminars have received unanimous
acclaim.
""2023 is a year for further deepening the strategic partnership between China and Bangladesh.""
Echoed by no one but to no avail
The ambassador said China is the most reliable development partner and a true friend of
Bangladesh. It is a conclusion widely endorsed by all walks of life across the country.
""However, alongside the steady progress of China-Bangladesh relations, some disturbing noises
emerge once in a while.""
""China-Bangladesh cooperation finds its roots deep in the long-established friendship between
the two peoples. It would have been impossible without the political guidance of our respective
leaderships.
“The precious achievement is jointly made by contributors from various sectors and positions like
you and thus should be cherished by heart and maintained with care.
“The attempts to interfere with China-Bangladesh cooperation will be echoed by no one but to no
avail,” he said, adding that through actions they would showcase to the world “what true friends
and best partners really mean.""

“Right now, there have been 50 flights flying between China and Bangladesh every week, and
nearly 10 thousand people commute to and from our two countries on a weekly basis.”
“More direct flights from Dhaka to Beijing will be opened very soon, so as to provide more
diverse flight options and make people-to-people exchanges even more convenient,” he said.
The ambassador said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has commended BRI for opening a new door
of development for Bangladesh.
“I firmly believe that this door not only carries mega projects to drive economic development but
also nurtures people-to-people exchanges and mutual learning between the two countries,” he
said.
“China is committed to ensuring those training programs are well-implemented and built into an
important platform for bilateral exchanges, thereby bringing the China-Bangladesh strategic
partnership of cooperation to a new level.”

Exploring BRI facilities to strengthen maritime security

In the context of an ever-growing focus of international politics on Asia in the twenty-first
century, Bangladesh's geo-strategic location in the Bay of Bengal provides the country with
a significant strategic maritime space. Bangladesh is located on the northern border of the
Bay of Bengal with about a 710 kilometre-long coastline. The country has obtained a sea
area of about 166,000 square kilometres after the demarcation of its maritime boundary
with Myanmar in 2012 and with India in 2014. This maritime area serves as the lifeline of
Bangladesh's economic development - about 30 million people of the country are directly
connected to the ocean-based economy.
From the geo-economic aspects, the sea and adjacent coastal areas of Bangladesh contain
a huge amount of proven living and non-living resources, including fisheries, energies,
minerals, and hydrocarbons. For instance, in January 2018, Bangladesh discovered about
600 billion cubic feet of gas reserves in its southern coastal district of Bhola. In terms of
fisheries, there are about 475 species of fish in the coastal areas of Bangladesh, accounting
for about 2.73 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and about 4.9 per
cent of its total export earnings, while generating about 12 per cent of its total employment.
All these indicate the significance of maritime security for Bangladesh in order to continue
the upward trend of its economic development with the annual growth rate averaging
about seven per cent. Bangladesh has a bigger scope to employ its blue economy for
national development and, thereby, maximise its geo-economic opportunities. In view of
the potential of the blue economy, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has rightly remarked,
""Blue economy is a concept which can significantly contribute to the socio-economic
development of Bangladesh.""
However, geopolitically, Bangladesh's maritime area is vulnerable to a number of
conventional security threats. The maritime area of the country contains two critical sea
lines of communications (SLOCs): the first one goes east to Southeast Asia, China andBN

and so on. Bangladesh is exposed to the great power rivalry in the Indian Ocean. The
command of the Bay of Bengal has long been a key issue of contention among the major
powers of the world, including the USA, China, Japan, and India.
Bangladesh has undertaken a number of measures to modernise its maritime defence
forces through capacity building and technological advancement. China's assistance to
Bangladesh has been proven crucial in this regard. These two countries have been
maintaining a close relationship for the last two decades. China has been playing a vital
role in the modernisation of Bangladesh Navy through providing technological and
infrastructural assistance. China sold a large number of naval equipments to Bangladesh
over the last few years. For instance, in between 2009 and 2015, Bangladesh purchased six
surface ships from China, including two patrol boats with modest anti-surface and anti-
submarine capabilities, and two ex-Jianghu-III Chinese frigates. China also offered shipping
designs and technologies to the shipyards of Bangladesh Navy in 2015-16. As a part of its
'three dimension' goal, Bangladesh Navy purchased two refurbished submarines from
China, named BNS Nabajatra and Joyjatra, both delivered in November 2016.
Along with these developments, the 'Belt and Road Initiative' (BRI) has widened the scope
of Bangladesh-China bilateral maritime security cooperation. BRI is the most significant
and far-reaching project that China has ever put forward. Bangladesh is an important
strategic partner with China in this two-dimensional mega-project, comprising the Silk
Road Economic Belt and the Twenty-first Century Maritime Silk Road. The Maritime Silk
Road encompasses both the major sea lanes of communications of Bangladesh in the Bay
of Bengal. China also frequently uses these sea routes, which, in fact, serve as its distant
sea-lifelines for energy supplies from Middle East and African coasts. However, increasing
American naval presence in the Asia Pacific in recent years as well as the growing threat of
maritime piracy in the Indian Ocean has raised China's tension about the future security of
these SLOCs.
In this regard, BRI provides China with a strategic scope of using Bangladesh's sea routes as
well as its sea ports to establish overland connectivity between the Bay of Bengal and its
landlocked Yunnan province, and, thereby, avoiding its Malacca dilemma. Bangladesh, on
the other hand, gets the scope to upgrade its naval capabilities and sea ports by China's
technical and financial assistance. Therefore, enhanced bilateral maritime security
cooperation with China under the broad framework of BRI is likely to provide a geo-
strategic leverage for Bangladesh in South Asia and boost its capacity to effectively mitigate
maritime security threats.

Balancing ties with China and India

 For all latest news, follow The Financial Express Google News channel.
In the previous article (Part I), we have discussed how Bangladeshʼs emerging economic
relationship with China can lead to new developments in its bilateral negotiations with
India, which are required for resolving some of the crucial issues like Ganges and Teesta
water-sharing disputes, trade imbalances, and economic dependency. We emphasized how
Chinaʼs expanding influence in South Asia, particularly through its Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI), presents Bangladesh with unique opportunities to strengthen its bargaining power
with India. By diversifying its economic ties, attracting Chinese investments, and enhancing
water resource management through Chinese-backed infrastructure projects, Bangladesh
can push India toward more cooperative and equitable agreements.
Building on these strategic insights, Part II explores in greater detail how Bangladeshʼs
defense, security, infrastructure, and diplomatic partnerships with China might continue to
reshape Indiaʼs engagement of the region. We discuss how security cooperation with China
might encourage India to upgrade its military relations with Bangladesh toward more
regional stability and robust bilateral dialogues. We also examine how Bangladeshʼs
increasing infrastructure development under Chinaʼs BRI might force India to accelerate its
cross-border connectivity projects in order to maintain regional competitiveness.
Finally, we discuss how Bangladeshʼs improved diplomatic standing in key regional
organizations such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and the
Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) Economic Corridor can strengthen its influence
on India regarding unresolved issues like trade agreements, transit arrangements, and
water-sharing negotiations. As former U.S. As the Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wisely
said, “In crises, the most daring decision is often the safest.” By using its strategic
relationship with China, Bangladesh can turn the tables and change its regional position so
that India will have to approach bilateral negotiations with greater urgency, flexibility, and
mutual respect.
This second part comprehensively analyzes how Bangladesh can convert its geo-economic
vulnerabilities into strategic assets by balancing its relations with both regional giants. ABN
25/05/2025, 11:14 Balancing ties with China and India | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/balancing-ties-with-china-and-india 1/6well-calibrated foreign policy driven by national interest may transform Bangladesh from a
passive regional player to an assertive diplomatic force capable of shaping the geopolitical
landscape of South Asia.
Security and Defense Balance: Chinaʼs expanding role as a defense supplier to Bangladesh
has fundamentally altered the regional security dynamics of South Asia. By supplying
submarines, naval vessels, missile systems, and advanced military technologies, China has
positioned itself as a critical defense partner for Bangladesh. India views this growing
military cooperation with unease, realizing that its traditional strategic dominance in the
region is under threat.
Security Dialogues and Cooperation. Bangladeshʼs growing defense relationship with China
may influence India to seek deeper security arrangements with Dhaka. India may further
strengthen maritime security cooperation, counterterrorism operations, and intelligence-
sharing mechanisms to retain its leverage in Bangladeshʼs security calculus.
This may be done by expanding the scope of bilateral security dialogues on: (a) Maritime
Stability: Joint naval exercises and coordinated patrols in the Bay of Bengal to counter
Chinaʼs growing naval presence. (b) Counterterrorism and Border Management: Expanding
cross-border security protocols to combat smuggling, trafficking, and insurgency-related
threats. (c) Defense Technology and Training: Increasing military training programs and
defense technology transfers to Bangladeshʼs armed forces.
As aptly noted by former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, “The only thing we have to
fear is fear itself.” Proactive security cooperation with Bangladesh would reduce Indiaʼs
anxiety over Chinaʼs strategic military foothold in South Asia.
Broader Regional Security and Strategic Stability. A greater regional framework involving
Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar on security issues in order to balance Chinaʼs
fast-developing defense relations in the Bay of Bengal would not be out of place either. The
cooperation in disaster management, peacekeeping operations, and maritime security,
meanwhile, will further reinforce the regional stability against Chinaʼs strategic depth in
South Asia.
As former Indian National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon once said, “Regional
cooperation in security is not a luxury but a necessity for maintaining peace and
development in South Asia.” Indiaʼs recalibrated security policy toward Bangladesh could
exemplify this philosophy.
Negotiation on Infrastructure and Connectivity: The BRI has shaped Bangladeshʼs
infrastructure landscape, wherein projects such as the Payra Deep-Sea Port, Karnaphuli
Tunnel, and Padma Bridge have enhanced economic connectivity. India needs to fast-track
its cross-border transit agreements and connectivity projects so that China does not
monopolize critical infrastructure development in Bangladesh.
Strengthening Transit and Connectivity Arrangements
India could fast-track key infrastructure projects such as: (a) India-Bangladesh Coastal
Shipping Agreement: developing sea-borne trade through ports at Chattogram and Mongla,
among others. (b) Expanding cargo routes through Indian northeastern states via the so-
called BBIN corridor for transshipment. (c) Reinforcing cross-border rail lines, such as the
Agartala-Akhaura and Kolkata-Chattogram routes.
By developing connectivity projects, India can decrease the dependence of Bangladesh on
China-funded infrastructure, thus ensuring far greater regional integration.
Strategic Impact on Regional Trade. Improved transit arrangements would place
Bangladesh as a strategic trade hub, connecting South Asia and Southeast Asia. More
regional trade corridors would also lead to the diversification of Bangladeshʼs economic
partners and greater economic independence from China.
As former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh aptly said, “Connectivity is the lifeline of
the economy in the modern world.” In chasing mutual infrastructure objectives,25/05/2025, 11:14 Balancing ties with China and India | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/balancing-ties-with-china-and-india 2/6Bangladesh and India could achieve higher efficiency in trade and greater regional
integration.
Diplomatic Maneuvering in Regional Organizations. Bangladeshʼs improved relations with
China have given the country a higher status in powerful regional platforms such as BRICS,
the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar
(BCIM) Economic Corridor. This increased diplomatic profile provides substantial strategic
leverage vis-à-vis India.
Enhancement of Bangladeshʼs Strategic Leverage
Chinaʼs international reach in multilateral organizations provides yet another platform to
Bangladesh for putting pressure on India on critical issues relating to water-sharing and
trade integration. China, an important player in water management and economic projects,
is likely to convince India through its involvement towards a more cooperative attitude.
Strategic Influence on Bilateral Engagements. It might push India to offer better trade,
water-sharing, and investment deals as a counterbalance to the fast-expanding role of
China in Bangladeshʼs strategic affairs: faster resolution of the long-stalled Teesta Water
Treaty, reduced trade tariffs, and more development aid packages.
As former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wisely said, “In crises, the most daring
decision is often the safest.” The more Bangladesh could establish its strategic worth
through Sino-Bangladeshi cooperation, the better the deals it could negotiate with India.
Conclusion: A Strategic Balancing Act for Bangladesh: Bangladeshʼs deepening ties with
China present a critical opportunity to reshape its regional diplomacy by balancing Indiaʼs
dominance while advancing its national development goals. Strengthening its economic
partnership, expanding military cooperation, and securing diplomatic support from China
can help Bangladesh address long-standing bilateral challenges with India—particularly in
water-sharing agreements, trade negotiations, security dialogues, and cross-border
infrastructure projects.
All of that, however, requires tremendous skill in diplomacy, political foresight, and
strategic patience. This art of balance between China and India is a delicate balance for
Bangladesh, in which neither should be given disproportionate influence while fostering
cooperation where there is a benefit to her national interests. As once famously said by
Singaporeʼs founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, “In the end, geopolitics is about balance
of power. You align where your interests lie.”
By leveraging Chinaʼs strategic investments while enjoying constructive relations with India,
Bangladesh has an opportunity to evolve from a regional underdog into a significant
powerbroker in South Asia. How well the country negotiates concessions, secures fair
treaties, and further strengthens its economy depends on this tightrope walk. As former
U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger aptly said, “In crises, the most daring decision is
often the safest.”
Bangladesh now stands on the threshold of redefining its geopolitical future-turning
geographic vulnerabilities into strategic assets under a robust foreign policy framework. It
is capable of transforming regional challenges into platforms for lasting stability,
prosperity, and global recognition with prudent, visionary leadership and a well-defined
national vision. As the Chinese proverb goes: “When the wind of change blows, some build
walls, others build windmills.”
It is time for Bangladesh to build its windmills, harnessing the changing geopolitical winds
to secure a brighter, more resilient future.

Hasina, Xi pledge to boost strategic ties
Thu Jul 11, 2024 03:00 AM
Last update on: Thu Jul 11, 2024 07:53 PM
China has promised to provide economic support to Bangladesh in the form of
grants and three types of loans including interest-free ones.
The pledge came yesterday as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina wrapped up her
China visit, holding talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.চীেনর  কােছ  যা  চেয়িছল  তার  কতট  ক ু  পল  বাংলােদশ ? | Bangladesh-China Bilater al চীেনর  কােছ  যা  চেয়িছল  তার  কতট  ক ু  পল  বাংলােদশ ? | Bangladesh-China Bilater al ……
China also offered Bangladesh one billion Yuan (about $140 million) as economic
assistance, Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud said at a press briefing in Beijing
prior to Hasina's departure for Dhaka last night.
Beijing said it attaches utmost importance to its relationship with Dhaka and
assured Bangladesh of continued support for its journey of development.
At the meeting with Hasina, Xi said China wants to invest more in Bangladesh and
work with it on the international stage.
""China and Bangladesh will work together to establish global peace and
prosperity,"" Hasan Mahmud said.
Xi brought up the Rohingya issue, the foreign minister said.
""I know that you have sheltered millions of Rohingyas who were displaced from
Myanmar. This is a burning issue for you. We will do our best to help you resolve
it,"" Hasan Mahmud quoted Xi.
China will play an important role towards solving the Rohingya crisis by holding
talks with the Myanmar government, and even with the Arakan army if necessary,
he mentioned.
Technical committees from both the countries will sit together to decide how the
four types of financial assistance will be given to Bangladesh. A technical
committee from China will soon visit Bangladesh, BSS quoted Hasan Mahmud as
saying.
Hasina left for China on July 8 following a state visit to India just two weeks
before. She returned home from Beijing early today.
Experts say the back-to-back visits are a way of balancing the relationship with
the Asian powers that are vying for influence in the Indian Ocean region.
Hasina last visited China in 2019.
Back in 2016, Xi visited Dhaka when Bangladesh joined the Chinese Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) and elevated the relationship to ""strategic partnership of
cooperation"".
Yesterday, the two leaders elevated the relationship to ""comprehensive strategic
cooperative partnership"".
Xi said, ""We, the two countries, are going to celebrate 50 years of diplomatic
relations next year. Marking the celebration, we want to take the existing strategic
relations to the second step.""
Hasina invited the Chinese president, the prime minister and others to visit
Bangladesh next year to celebrate the 50 years of diplomatic relations between
the two countries.
""You stood firm against foreign interference. This not only demonstrates your
conviction to stand upright against the pressure, but also the courage of the
Bangladeshi people as an independent people,"" Xi told Hasina according to a pool
report made available to this newspaper.
He said China consistently opposes interference in other countries' internal
affairs under any pretext, and firmly supports Bangladesh in its pursuit for a
development path that suits it.
Xi expressed his readiness to work with Hasina to improve bilateral relations
based on a strategic and long-term perspectives, deepen political trust, and carry
forward the traditional friendship.
He called for joining hands to boost Belt and Road cooperation, collaboration in
various fields, and establish the ""comprehensive strategic cooperative
partnership"" between the two countries.
Xi also expressed his desire to contribute to the development of South Asia and
the Global South, according to the pool report.
Hasina reassured Xi about Taiwan -- Beijing's most sensitive issue -- saying
""Bangladesh firmly adheres to the one-China principle, supports China's position
on the Taiwan issue, and resolutely opposes external forces interfering in China's
internal affairs"", reported South China Morning Post.
Hasina said she faced many problems in holding elections and that there were
some quarters who always try to disrupt the polls.
""…I always enjoy the people's support and with the people's support, we won the
election. This is my fourth consecutive term. So, I feel that I have big
responsibility for my people,"" she said thanking Xi for always supporting her.
""And after the elections, your message gives us more enthusiasm,"" she said.
Hasina thanked the Chinese president for helping Bangladesh build some iconic
structures, including the Padma Bridge and Bangabandhu Tunnel.
Xi assured Bangladesh of providing assistance in the development of its southern
part as Hasina sought support towards this end.
She raised the issue of trade imbalance between the two countries and called
upon China to mitigate the gap. In 2022-23, the bilateral trade was $24 billion, but
Bangladesh exported to China goods worth less than $700 million.
In response, Xi said China will import more goods, including mangoes, from
Bangladesh.
In response to Hasina's request for Chinese assistance in developing Bangladesh's
agriculture sector, Xi assured her of providing technical support and necessary
training.
Xi stressed the need for more cultural exchanges and people-to-people contact.
Noting the deepening relations between the Awami League and the Chinese
Communist Party, he said, ""Good governance needs good party.""
Earlier in the day, Hasina had a delegation-level meeting with Chinese Premier Li
Qiang.
She requested her Chinese counterpart to import leather products, jute products,
pharmaceutical goods, and ceramic products from Bangladesh.
Hasina invited more Chinese investments in 100 special economic zones and
Bangabandhu Industrial Park, mentioning that Bangladesh has allotted one
export processing zone for Chinese investors.
She stressed the need for Bangladesh's inclusion in BRICS in any form. In
response, Li Qiang assured her of Chinese support.
Hasina also sought Chinese cooperation so that Bangladesh could enjoy the LDC
facilities at least for three more years after it graduates to a middle-income
country in 2026. The Chinese prime minister gave a positive response.
Both the leaders put emphasis on celebrating the Golden Jubilee of their
diplomatic relationship in a befitting manner.
Bangladesh and China also signed 21 instruments and made seven
announcements.
The instruments involve the banking sector, trade and investment, digital
economy, infrastructure, disaster management, export of agricultural products
from Bangladesh, and people-to-people connectivity.
On Tuesday, Hasina attended a trade and investment summit participated by
businesses from both countries.
Bangladeshi and Chinese companies signed 16 MoUs to boost collaboration in
textiles, electric vehicles, solar power, financial technology, and other technology.
Four of these MoUs will bring in nearly $500 million in investments.
Hasina also met Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) President Jin Liqun
and requested him to cut the interest rates on its loans for Bangladesh and
finance infrastructure, river dredging, and climate-resilient houses.
According to former ambassador to China Munshi Faiz Ahmad, elevating the
relationship to ""comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership"" means the two
countries will now cooperate in all sectors and further deepen their bilateral
relationship.
People often think there are military components when the word ""strategic"" is
used, which is not correct.
Bangladesh was seeking a loan of $5 billion in Yuan amid foreign currency
shortage but the terms and conditions were not agreed upon.
Faiz said China has pledged 1 billion Yuan and more will follow as evident in Xi's
words.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), reminiscent of the Silk Road, is a long-term
infrastructural project that would stretch from the heart of China, all the way to Europe
which will help Asia cope with infrastructure financing gaps.
This was echoed by President of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS)
Major General ANM Muniruzzaman and Editor of Dhaka Tribune Zafar Sobhan in their
remarks at the BIPSS-Dhaka Tribune Roundtable titled, 'Belt and Road Initiative (BRI):
Connecting the World', which was held at the Westin, reports UNB.
The BRI project of China will create partnership linkages among the sub-regions of South
Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. BRI presents an array of opportunities for
Bangladesh, they said.
The roundtable was attended by diplomats, scholars, security experts, and youth
representatives from various disciplines.
BIPSS President Muniruzzaman highlighted the key facets and variables concerning BRI, the
underlying opportunities and challenges, and what it means for Bangladesh to maintain a
strategic balance being a member of the grand infrastructural initiative.
He said BRI is happening at a time when significant changes are taking place in the
international system, according to a media release issued on Monday.
Zafar Sobhan, editor of The Dhaka Tribune, in his welcome remarks said it is important to
take a deeper look at BRI projects, including how they may affect Bangladesh.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/belt-and-road-initiative-to-create-partnership-linkages-roundtable-1640002749 1/5Muniruzzaman further discussed how Bangladesh has a significant geostrategic role in BRI.
“We expect that BRI projects shouldnʼt cause any harm to the environment,” he added.
While discussing the project of the century, Muniruzzaman focused on how BRI
encompasses several continents in a network of roads and sea-routes.
The first keynote speaker, Dr. Fahmida Khatun, Executive Director of Centre for Policy
Dialogue (CPD), began her remarks with an emphasis on the economic and trade benefits
of BRI, and its implications for Bangladesh.
During her speech, she also highlighted the infrastructural gap currently existing in
Bangladesh and BRI will be a key supplement to fulfilling this gap.
Fahmida Khatun said it is imperative for Bangladesh to follow a cautious approach
regarding Chinese investments.
Highlighting the role of BRI member countries, second keynote speaker Parvez Karim
Abbasi, Assistant Professor of the Department of Economics at East West University, began
his deliberations by talking about the geo-economic implications of BRI for the region.
He also highlighted the fact how the whole project of BRI is actually an integral part of the
Chinese socioeconomic identity.
Abbasi added, “BRI is a concrete manifestation of Chinaʼs emergence as an economic
powerhouse and it will help expand connectivity transcending the borders between
nations.”
He said the fate of China is intrinsically linked to BRI. ""Due to the pandemic, thereʼve been
major economic implications for the world. The small states need to take each step with
precision and clarity. The role of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has to be
studied with in-depth details.""
Summarizing the discussion, Muniruzzaman said although there will be major implications
for the signatory countries, they need to utilise the funds channeled through BRI for the
prosperity of our nation.
An interactive session with the audience was followed who further enriched the discussion.
The participants included foreign diplomats, security sector personnel, scholars and
journalists.

Interview: Chinese Am bassador Li Jim ing
Fu ture of C hina  and  B angl adesh relations is very brigh t
Published: 12 Dec 2022, 11: 59
Li Jiming came to Dhaka as China’s ambassador to Bangladesh in the second half of 2019.
Completing three years in office, he is now about to return home. He has spent an active
three years in Bangladesh, dealing with the Covid situation, trade and investment, and
further improving bilateral relations. In an interview with Prothom Alo, he talks about
bilateral relations, geopolitics and more. & Raheed Ejaz Ayesha Kabir
China's ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming at Prothom Alo office in Karwan Bazar, Dhaka,
on 4 December 2022 Prothom Alo25/05/2025, 10:09 Future of China and Bangladesh relations is very bright
https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/interview/2iooc0ih7s 1/7 : After  ser ving her e for  m or e than three yea rs you are leaving Dhaka. During your
assignm en t her e as the Chines e am bassador the whole world was fighting with Covid-
19. In the con tex t of  that, how  do you eva luate your assignm en t in Bangladesh? 
That is absolutely true that my three-year tenure here was mainly during the pandemic,
but that pandemic fighting was actually a good opportunity for us to take our cooperation
ahead. China and Bangladesh fought the pandemic with extreme success. There was
people-to-people caring for each other. I not only received supplies from the Bangladesh
government, but also from many individuals. I experienced very touching stories, very
memorable ones. It was a great privilege for me to be part of China-Bangladesh relations.
This is probably the most memorable time of my whole professional career.
 : W hile we ref er  to coop er ation  during the fight against Covid-19, China was
for thcom ing during the crisis of  Banglades h’s target to vaccinate the people. Can you tell
ou r rea der s how  bot h the cou ntries  tackle the situation with their joint effort during the
pandem ic?
We stood side by side during the whole period of time and it was actually Bangladesh that
offered a helping hand to us first. And then China also helped Bangladesh in its capacity. I
should mention that when Bangladesh faced a crisis of vaccines, I tried very hard to offer
Chinese vaccines to the Bangladesh government, but you could not accept at that time
unless the vaccines got approval of WHO (World Health Organisation) or five of the
advanced western economies’ FDA. At that time all the vaccines were very new. The
Chinese vaccine Sinopharm or Sinovac hadn’t got the approval at the time. Bangladesh
needed vaccines and China had the capacity to provide the vaccines, but we had to wait for
that approval. With joint effort from both sides, Bangladesh finally issued the grant for
emergency use prior to WHO while the latter said it would be issuing its approval soon. In
this regard, the Bangladesh government was quite determined and very responsible. I
really appreciate that.
Immediately after we got this approval from the Bangladeshi government, we delivered
China-made vaccines in time in a large quantity. We donated a large number of vaccines
in a very quick way. Then the Chinese vaccine producers started the negotiations with
Bangladeshi authorities on commercial purchase and co-production. So the total number
of Chinese vaccines administered in this country exceeded 175 million. That is more than
the vaccines from all the other countries combined. Except for vaccines, we also sent
medical personnel and provided PPEs and other supplies to Bangladesh for the joint fight
against the pandemic.Q
Q25/05/2025, 10:09 Future of China and Bangladesh relations is very bright
https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/interview/2iooc0ih7s 2/7Then there is a crucial matter that has never been mentioned. With the help of
concessional loan provided by the Chinese government, we supported the Info-Sarker
Phase-3 Project, a project focusing on development of national ICT infra-network for
Bangladesh government. With the infrastructure of connectivity, of network service,
optical cable connecting to the upazila level from Dhaka, the government keeps
functioning even during the lock-downs at the peak of pandemic. That played a
significant role as well.
Trade deficits are not always a bad thing for Bangladesh. If you look into
these figures, you will see that at least one third of trade deficit with
China is for buying raw materials which is important for your export and
trade surplus from other markets
 : China is devel op ing a spec ial ec on om ic zone in Chittagong, what sectors do China see
as an op por tunity for  further  en hancing econom ic ties bet ween  the two countries?
Different from the existing ones in the area, the Chinese Economic Zone is not an export
processing zone, but an industrial economic zone. RMG industry will not be a priority
there, maybe some, but not a major part of it. What will be located in that zone then? They
are talking about the green energy sectors, solar batteries, solar panels, e-vehicles, ICT
manufacturing and such. China is quite good at these, so the possibilities are high.
 : So you  are foc using m or e on  green  and clean ener gy, ICT and future technology for
the area s of  coop er ation .
Yes. We think that we should aim at higher end industries, not only RMG. In RMG we
already have plenty of space in other export oriented zones, but in this one we should have
higher end technology.
 : China is the larges t trading partner  of Bangladesh and has already provided 98 per
cen t zer o- tariff trea tm en t for  Bangladeshi products ex porting to China. However, the
trade gap is widen ing. Does  Bei jing have any plan for a balance of trade which is now
hea vily tilted  tow ards China?
Trade deficits are not always a bad thing for Bangladesh. If you look into these figures,
you will see that at least one third of trade deficit with China is for buying raw materials
which is important for your export and trade surplus from other markets. Another one
third is the machinery which is connected to RMG as well. And also one third is those
infrastructure facilities, like bridge and railway related equipment. All of those trade or
commodities are in the benefit of this country. So never consider that a bad thing, or thatQ
Q
Q25/05/2025, 10:09 Future of China and Bangladesh relations is very bright
https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/interview/2iooc0ih7s 3/7we should buy less. That is not always right.
We are talking about high end industry or high end manufacturing in Chittagong, the
China Economic Industrial Zone. With that being realised, there will be much more
products that can be more competitive into the Chinese market. We open our doors to the
Bangladesh industries.
Besides, in China we hold the China International Import Expo (CIIE) every year. It is the
world’s first import themed national-level expo. We also have the China-South Asia Expo.
These are perfect platforms for Bangladesh’s exporters to showcase their brands and
products to the Chinese consumers. If they make full use of such opportunities, the “Made
in Bangladesh” will be more famous to the Chinese market.
 : Since the signing of  M oU  on  the Belt and Road Initiative, Bei jing has engaged with
Banglades h in variou s significant projects including that of the Padm a Bridge Railway
proj ec t. Can you  shed  som e light on the latest status of two countries under the BRI?
Bangladesh is the first country in South Asia to jump on board the BRI. China-Bangladesh
cooperation under the BRI is so fruitful, which benefits the people of both countries. We
will witness some deeper cooperation under this framework.
But there are some issues that we should also tackle. First, BRI is often narrowly
interpreted and understood. BRI is not only for connectivity infrastructure hardware, but
also for policy coordination, trade facilitation, financial cooperation, and people-to-
people exchange. There are at least five aspects. So when we talk about BRI, we shall never
concentrate on connectivity only. That would be a mistake.
Second, we are talking about higher quality BRI cooperation. After the 20th national
congress of the CPC, the Communist Party of China announced that from now on we are
going to undertake a new journey toward Chinese modernisation. Within this overall
perspective, high quality BRI cooperation is a necessary. This means greener and cleaner
projects focusing on higher end development. In future cooperation with Bangladesh, we
can expect more than what we have already witnessed. Higher quality, broader concepts
will be included.
 : During the m iles ton e visit of  Pres ident Xi Jinping to Banglades h in 2016, China
agreed  to provi de suppor t in 22 projec ts and give m ore than $20 billion. After six years
the im plem en tation  of  the agreed  projects is ver y slow and the disbursem ent rate is also
not  significant. W hat is you r take on that?
The MOU that was signed is not a commitment of government concessional loans, but a
list of projects to be considered for promotion by both sides, not only China. If you look atQ
Q25/05/2025, 10:09 Future of China and Bangladesh relations is very bright
https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/interview/2iooc0ih7s 4/7the text of the MOU, then you will see that it is to show both sides that this is the priority
of our cooperation and some of them will be using the Chinese concessional loans and
some of those will be supported in some other ways. And for some of those projects, the
Bangladesh government needs to take the initiative. Up till today, to my knowledge, at
least one third of these 27 projects have been completed or under construction. For the
other two thirds, a half is under proactive assessment, another half is on pause since the
Bangladeshi government has not launched the projects or decided to halt.
For example, the state-owned jute factories. Even though China has approved to give
concessional loans, the Bangladesh government said no. This is not going to be included,
since the Bangladeshi side changed mind. We have to find some other ways to do it. There
are a number of such cases and we said we can replace them. We have a mechanism to
communicate and update. So it is not true that nothing significant has happened as the
media sometimes depict it.
 : In the last two yea rs we not iced  high level  reg ular com m unications between Prim e
M inister  Shei kh  Hasina and Pres ident Xi Jinping. How do you see these frequent
ex changes  bet ween  the top  lea ders ?
The political trust between the two countries is on a high level and very satisfactory. Last 
year and the year before there were exchanges of many letters, phone calls and video
messages on those highlighted occasions of both sides. It is the key to guarantee our
bilateral cooperation and to guide the two countries to go together in a more concerted
way.
 : During you r ten ure, C hines e for eign m inister  W ang Yi and defence m inister W ei
Fen ghe visited  Banglades h. Apart from  the bilater al rel ations, both the senior Chinese
lea der s tou ched  upon  the issues  of geo-politics. W hat is your ex pec tation from
Banglades h in the wake of  grow ing geo-political rivalry surrounding the Indo-Pacific
reg ion ?
Clearly China does not like any clique idea that aims at creating more uncertainties and
instabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. Neither does Bangladesh. We believe in the wisdom
of the leadership of Bangladesh because we know that Friendship to All and Malice
towards None is always at the core of Bangladesh’s diplomatic policy.
The Cold War has been ended for decades, but the mentality of the Cold War is still there.
Look at Europe, what the expansion of NATO, a product of the Cold War mentality, has
resulted in? If that kind of mentality is expanded to this region, what can we expect?Q
Q25/05/2025, 10:09 Future of China and Bangladesh relations is very bright
https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/interview/2iooc0ih7s 5/7 : For  the last few  yea rs China m ed iates  between Bangladesh and M yanm ar to initiate
Roh ingya rep atriation . Even  a date was fixed for the com m en cem en t of repatriation.
Also, l ast yea r’s m ilitary cou p in M yanm ar crea ted  further uncertainty about the hope of
Roh ingya rep atriation . From  you r perspective, in which direction is the crisis headed?
This is something I have put much energy into, but unfortunately hasn’t got much output
yet. Let’s see what are the possibilities ahead.
Possibility number one, people are talking about integration now. Turkey has integrated
some refugees. They have their policy. But is this an alternative for Bangladesh? I doubt it.
Possibility number two, people are seeking more pressure on Myanmar from the
international community. I fully understand this motivation, but, unfortunately, it
doesn’t seem to work well. Be it the case brought to the International Court of Justice or
other initiatives, they are not paying off. Why? Because the current regime in Myanmar
has been in power for over four decades, and they have always been under international
pressure, but they survived. They have many other issues to care about. The marginal
effect of international pressure on Myanmar is diminishing.
Now we come to the third and last possibility, repatriation through bilateral dialogue.
Between Bangladesh and Myanmar, you have the mechanism called JWG (joint working
group) that has had at least five sessions. It is widely considered to be successful. Though
the immediate repatriation faces some difficulty due to the current situation in Myanmar,
things are still progressing in a spiral way. Probably we should be more patient and wait
for the conditions to become more conducive. Otherwise if we push the first batch of
repatriated people to Myanmar, but something bad happens to them, it will put the
following batches into doom. We can’t take the risk.
 : W hat is you r ex pec tation  on  peop le-to-people exchanges bet ween  China and
Banglades h?
We are witnessing growing people-to-people exchange over the past decade, and there
are more to expect. As of now, as many as six Chinese universities offer Bengali language
course. And there are more than 15,000 Bangladeshi students studying in China. Beyond
the scholarship provided by central government of China, many other scholarships are
also given at the provincial and university levels. In Bangladesh, we hope to see China
study centres being set up. There needs to be more think tanks and scholars who are
authoritative in China studies. The local media needs some original thinking of your own.
I believe that the future is very bright between our two countries and two peoples.

Although the Belt-and-Road Initiative (BRI) emerges as a transformative opportunity and
holds with tremendous potential for Bangladesh, its potential growth remain still untapped
significantly in the last 10 years.
Speakers made the observations at the launch of a report styled 'BRI in Bangladesh:
Achievement and Way Forward' at a city hotel on Thursday night.
The Chinese Embassy hosted the event on the 10th anniversary of BRI, which was unveiled
by President Xi Jinping in 2013 stating that it rolled out investment of hundreds of billions
of dollars in critical infrastructure across countries, including Bangladesh.
Education minister Dr Dipu Moni attended the event as the chief guest while Chinese
ambassador Yao Wan was a keynote speaker.
Speakers said infrastructural development and enhanced trade connectivity under BRI
have taken place against the backdrop of Bangladesh's remarkable progress in socio-
economic development over past decades.
But they pointed out that the country's exports to China remain less than $1.0 billion,
leaving ample room for further expansion.
The speakers, therefore, called for exploring trade and investment opportunities and
technology transfer to reap the benefits of BRI along with investment in infrastructure
development.

were panellists there.
BGMEA president Faruque Hassan also spoke, among others.
RAPID chairman Dr Mohammad Abdur Razzaque presented the report that showed
Bangladesh's trade with China rose to 18 per cent in 2022 from only 7.0 per cent in 2021.
The report showed China's pledge to Bangladesh was $40 billion since the launch of BRI in
2013, but only $4.45 billion was disbursed by April 2023.
Twenty-five projects were undertaken, but 10 have so far been implemented successfully, it
cited.
As BRI focuses on areas like infrastructure, energy and socio-cultural exchange, projects like
Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Karnaphuli Tunnel, Dhaka Elevated Expressway,
Dhaka-Ashulia Elevated Expressway, Dhaka Bypass, ICT Intra-Network, Dasherkandi
Sewerage Treatment Plant, and Power System Network were implemented with Chinese
funds.
Dr Dipu recalled Chinese contribution to the country's development as a steadfast ally,
saying the BRI has opened a new door in taking the relationship into a new height.
Terming it a ""visionary global endeavour"", she also said the relationship built on trust and
cooperation and mutual benefit serves as an example in international partnership under
BRI.
Meanwhile, envoy Wan said Chinese investment in Bangladesh increased from $241 million
in 2016 to $1.346 billion in 2022 after it joined the BRI as the first south Asian country.
He disclosed that China built 12 roads, 21 bridges, and 27 power and energy projects in
Bangladesh while Chinese companies created more than 550,000 jobs here.
There were more than 670 Chinese companies operating in Bangladesh the ambassador
said adding that two-way trade was $22.8 billion in 2022, up from $15.3 billion.
On the occasion, Mr Wan awarded licences to 16 Chinese companies whose South Asian
headquarters are in Bangladesh.

The China-Bangladesh Friendship is a model of peaceful coexistence in the new era
Peng Nian
Update : 11 Jul 2024, 02:57 AM
At the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina started
her China visit on July 8. This is her first visit to China after taking office and her second visit to
China in five years. Last August, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Hasina during the
BRICS Summit held in Johannesburg, South Africa.Publish : 11 Jul 2024, 02:57 AM

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/351714/a-deepening-friendship 1/4The frequent high-ranking visits between the two top leaders of China and Bangladesh reflect the
high degree of mutual trust. It is also an important manifestation of the new vitality of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (the Five Principles) in the new era.
PM Hasina’s visit comes shortly after the successful convening of the conference marking the
70th Anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence held in Beijing on June 28.
Seventy years ago, more than 20 Asian and African countries gathered in Bandung and proposed
10 principles for handling interstate relations, advocating the Bandung spirit of unity, friendship,
and cooperation.
Over the past 70 years, the Five Principles have been embraced by an ever-growing number of
countries, evolving into open, inclusive, and universally applicable basic norms of international
relations and fundamental principles of international law, guiding the continuous advancement of
China-Bangladesh relations.
During her meeting with President Xi Jinping last August, Prime Minister Hasina stated that the
excellent relations between Bangladesh and China were based on mutual respect and
noninterference in each other’s internal affairs.
Over the past 49 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China has not only
refrained from meddling in Bangladesh’s internal affairs but also opposed external interference,
jointly safeguarding each other’s core interests.
During Bangladesh’s parliamentary election earlier this year, China consistently adhered to the
principle of noninterference and fully respected the choice of the Bangladeshi people. In contrast,
on the eve of the election, the US Department of State called for fair, just, transparent, and
democratic elections in Bangladesh. After PM Hasina’s victory in the election, the US
Department of State criticized the election as not being free and fair.
x25/05/2025, 14:55 A deepening friendship
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/351714/a-deepening-friendship 2/4This led to PM Hasina’s public statement in May 2024 where she revealed that she was offered a
“smooth return to power” in exchange for leasing the country’s land for a foreign airbase.
Although she did not disclose the name of the country that made the offer, it is widely believed
that the offer would have come from the United States.
Over the past 49 years, China-Bangladesh cooperation has continued to deepen, with mutually
beneficial and win-win outcomes. China has remained Bangladesh’s largest trading partner and
the largest source of imports for 13 consecutive years, and it is also an important source of raw
materials for Bangladesh’s manufacturing industry. Moreover, Bangladesh is China’s second
largest trading partner in South Asia.
 Since Bangladesh joined the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2016, bilateral trade between
China and Bangladesh has grown from $15.3 billion in 2016 to $27.8bn in 2022, reaching a new
historical high.
China is also Bangladesh’s second largest source of foreign investment. Since 2016, the stock of
Chinese investment in Bangladesh has soared from $241m to $1.346bn in 2022. As of September
2023, the total amount of Chinese investment in Bangladesh reached $3.17bn, with 21 bridges
and 27 power projects implemented in the country. A large number of flagship projects, such as
the Padma Bridge and the Dasherkandi Sewage Treatment Plant, have been successfully
completed, providing a boost to Bangladesh’s economic development.
Currently, more than 670 Chinese enterprises are investing and operating in Bangladesh, driving
employment for over 550,000 locals and benefiting the local population with the dividends of
development. According to Bangladeshi scholars, in recent years, there has been a surge in the
number of Chinese enterprises investing in Bangladesh, and the number of Chinese people in
Bangladesh has increased significantly. This has made Bangladesh a new “hot land” for Chinese
investment in South Asia.
There are also high expectations for PM Hasina’s China trip, both among Chinese and
Bangladeshi experts. It is hoped that China’s Global Development Initiative (GDI) will push
forward China-Bangladesh trade and investment cooperation to a new level and enhance
Bangladesh’s transportation, power, and energy infrastructure, as well as its digital economy and
blue economy development.
We also look forward to promoting the strategic docking of China’s GDI, BRI, and Bangladesh’s
“Vision 2041” and the dream of “Shonar Bangla,” thereby making more robust economic ties

for both sides.
Due to the fierce strategic confrontation between China and the United States, China and
Bangladesh have also strengthened their policy communication on several international and
regional issues based on their common interests. In April 2023, Bangladesh announced its “Indo-
Pacific Outlook,” distancing itself from the United States’ “Indo-Pacific Strategy.” This reflects a
neutral position of Bangladesh amid China-US competition rather than a swing to the US.
Two months later, Bangladesh officially applied to join the BRICS, a fast-growing global
organization founded by China, Russia, India, Brazil, and South Africa. In response, China has
expressed full support for Bangladesh’s early admission as a new member of the BRICS.
Under China’s diplomatic mediation, Bangladesh and Myanmar signed an agreement on the
repatriation of Rohingya refugees in 2017. During the past seven years, Bangladesh has made
great contributions to jointly solving the Rohingya crisis. As the Chinese ambassador to
Bangladesh Yao Wen said, China understands and sympathizes with the tremendous costs that
Bangladesh has borne regarding the Rohingya issue and strives to restart the repatriation process
for Rohingya refugees.

https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/siz624stg2 1/3China's ambassador to Bangladesh, Li Jiming, said that Bangladesh offered its helping
hand to China during the early days of the Covid outbreak. After the situation in China
improved, China in turn offered their helping hand to Bangladesh.
During those challenging times, important strides were made in the relations between the
two countries, he added.
Ambassador Li Jiming made these remarks at the Prothom Alo office on Sunday.
The outgoing ambassador came to visit the Prothom Alo office in the afternoon. He was
received by the editor of Prothom Alo, Matiur Rahman. They held a meeting to exchange
views.
After the meeting, Li Jiming spoke in an interview with Prothom Alo about bilateral
relations, cooperation and more.
After his stint of more than three years in Bangladesh, Li Jiming will be leaving Dhaka in
the second week of December.
When asked about how relations had been during his term as ambassador, he said he had
felt very honoured to be the ambassador of China to Bangladesh, shouldering the mission
for the President of China, President Xi Jingping to uplift the strategic partnership of
cooperation between China and Bangladesh to a higher level.
Li Jiming further said there had been significant progress and bilateral relationship has
been strengthened in many ways, especially during the pandemic.
He said Bangladesh was the first country to jump on board the Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) in South Asia and sign the MOU in this regard. Over the past three years, BRI has had
a lot of achievements, he said, pointing to the examples of Payra power plant, the

this is not just a newspaper, but much more.
""The Bangladesh media is very dynamic and pro-active. The professionalism of the media
is impressive,"" Li Jiming said.
However, he felt that Bangladesh's media relied on sources from the West rather than
original ones. For example, he said, the media used western sources only when reporting
on the Ukraine crisis or the issue of Uyghur's Muslims in China. But in general,
Bangladesh's media is very friendly towards China, Li Jiming said.25/05/2025, 10:11 ‘Important strides made in Bangladesh-China relations during pandemic’

https://en.bd-pratidin.com/international/2025/04/19/34965 1/10A parliamentary
investigation into
Nepal’ s Pokhara
International Airport
has uncovered
severe corruption
and mismanagement
linked to the $216
million project, which was built by the Chinese state-
owned contractor , CAMC Engineering. The report,
released Thursday , exposes numerous failures on the part
of CAMC, including incomplete work, poor-quality
construction, tax evasion, and failure to meet project
specifications.
The inquiry found that CAMC, a subsidiary of China’ s
Sinomach conglomerate, was paid for work it did not
complete, including a fuel supply facility and HVAC
system. Despite these failings, the construction company
was allegedly granted preferential treatment, with Nepali
authorities waiving over $16 million in taxes due from the
company . The airport, which  was funded by a loan from
the Export-Import Bank of China, has become a financial
burden for Nepal, failing to meet passenger trafficNepali citizens welcome Chinese passengers from the first international

repaying the loan.
The investigation revealed that CAMC failed to finish
crucial infrastructure, including a second runway . The
airport now operates with just one runway , which has
been deemed unsafe for full use. In addition, the report
alleges that the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN),
responsible for overseeing the project, allowed CAMC to
disregard its contractual obligations to avoid upsetting
Beijing.
China hailed the Pokhara International Airport as part of
its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), but the project has failed
to deliver the expected results. Nepal now faces the
difficult task of repaying the loan with limited international
traffic and growing concerns over the quality of the
infrastructure.
The findings of the parliamentary inquiry have sparked
outrage among lawmakers, with calls for the suspension
of officials responsible for the project’ s oversight. The
report highlights the need for greater transparency in the
management of foreign-funded infrastructure projects and
greater accountability for both contractors and
government agencies.

Making the most of our trade
relationship with China
Sat Sep 1, 2018 12:00 AM
Last update on: Sat Sep 1, 2018 01:15 PM
According to the Financial Times (US), the USD 3.7 billion Padma Rail link, for
which Beijing has provided more than USD 3 billion, will serve as ""a physical
reminder of China's growing presence"" in Bangladesh. Other media outlets and
commentators too have been making similar remarks about China's increasing
role in Bangladesh's development and economic activities recently, and for good
reasons.
As pointed out by Gateway House, ""China has committed to USD 31 billion worth
of projects in Bangladesh, making it the second-biggest recipient of money in
South Asia behind Pakistan,"" including on ""roads, railways, coal power plants and
water treatment facilities."" Once private sector investments are included, this
goes up to USD 42 billion, according to Ahsan Mansur, executive director of the
Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh.
The Financial Times (US) report says that Chinese companies are seeking to take
full advantage of the specially created economic zones in Bangladesh and are
therefore considering setting up shop here. Already Zhejiang Jindun Pressure
Vessel Co Ltd has offered to invest USD 5 billion in one zone to build up heavy
industry near Chittagong, including establishing a 2.6-gigawatt power plant,
which was the largest single investment proposal in the history of Bangladesh,
according to the chairman of the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority, Paban
Chowdhury.
While all this investment (if properly utilised) is sure to benefit Bangladesh and,
hopefully, China too, the real fruits of those benefits will take some time to
materialise. But in the meantime, what should not be overlooked is the
disappointing performance of Bangladesh's exports to China at a time when
imports from there (in the form of capital machineries and other resources) are
sure to be on the rise, as that may endanger tilting Bangladesh's trade deficit with
China even more to the extreme.
And by all indications, it looks like now is the time for the government to
intervene in order to check that from happening at a worrying degree.
In FY 2017-18, Bangladesh's exports to China fell by 26.79 percent year-on-year to
USD 694.97 million, despite China being one of the most promising markets in
Asia. Part of that was due to the China Food and Drug Administration toughening
its certification regulations and no longer accepting certification of the
Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution starting last year, as this newspaper
reported. This means that Bangladeshi processed food exporters have to wait for
days to receive testing certification from China, which is the main reason for the
fall in exports, according to ATM Azizul Akil, senior vice-president of Bangladesh
China Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This is one area where the government can easily use diplomacy to get a better
deal for exporters, while using this opportunity to raise its own certification
standards not only to further export opportunities, but also for the sake of better
domestic quality control.
That aside, Bangladesh as a least developed country is also supposed to enjoy
much greater duty benefit on exports to China than it currently does, as per a
decision of the World Trade Organisation's ministerial conference of 2006 held in
Hong Kong.
According to Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed, ""Under the Asia Pacific Trade
Agreement, 5,074 Bangladeshi products have been enjoying duty-free market
access but as per WTO rules China can provide DFQF [duty-free and quota-free]
market access for at least 97 percent of Bangladeshi products and we have sent a
letter of exchange to avail the trade facility."" In response, ""China offered that if
Bangladesh forgoes the existing benefits it is getting under APTA, the country
would consider providing DFQF market access"" to Bangladeshi products as per
the WTO rules.
Last week, the minister said that a memorandum of understanding has already
been agreed between the two countries for the signing of a free trade agreement.
But before it was signed, Bangladesh asked China to start providing the
prescribed duty benefit on export of Bangladeshi goods.
If Bangladesh can successfully negotiate the implementation of DFQF market
access to China, that will surely give a massive boost to exporters, increasing
chances of Bangladesh reducing its huge trade deficit with China. Therefore, this
is something that the government should urgently pursue.
However, while the government tries to resolve this issue, what exporters
themselves should keep in mind is that Bangladesh's export to China is lagging
behind not only because of policy issues, but because of other shortcomings too.
For example, according to Azizul Akil, export of jute, jute goods, leather and
leather goods are not doing as well as they could in Chinese markets simply
because of the poor negotiation skills of Bangladeshi exporters.
Garment exports to China also has remained stagnant for the last two years
primarily because of Myanmar and Vietnam—who export basic garment items to
China for lower- and middle-income groups similar to Bangladesh—taking
advantage of their geographical proximity to China. To overcome this, exporters
should look to diversify their products more or come up with other alternatives
instead of settling for the status quo, as China's demand for basic garment items
is still relatively high with its manufacturers mainly producing high-end products
for upscale western markets.
Ultimately, despite China's increased role in Bangladesh's economic development,
Bangladesh is yet to position itself in a way that would allow it to fully maximise
the benefits from this increased integration. This is something that the public
and private sectors should look to address with their respective Chinese partners,
in order to achieve what the Chinese president often terms as ""win-win"" outcome
for both countries.
And given the possibilities that lie ahead for both nations, there is no reason to
believe that such an outcome is not possible, should policymakers and other
stakeholders take the right steps and make the right decisions.

 For all latest news, follow The Financial Express Google News channel.
The majority of Bangladeshis have a positive impression about China, shows a recent
survey conducted by the Centre for the Genocide Studies of Dhaka University.
According to the survey, 46 per cent of respondents have good impression about China and
14 per cent have ʻvery goodʼ impression.
However, it is critical to note that 34 per cent of the respondents remained neutral and 6
per cent said their impression about China is poor.
“The survey report highlights that Bangladesh and China have enjoyed cordial and friendly
bilateral relations since their official diplomatic relations on October 4 in 1975,” said
Professor Imtiaz Ahmed, director of the Centre.
Essentially, the relationship between the two countries has been elevated from an
economic to a strategic partnership, he added.
“The survey demonstrates that the respondents are more optimistic about the Chinese
national image as a friendly country, Chinese people are friendly or peaceful,” he said.
The respondents significantly perceive China as a positive development partner of
Bangladesh and there is an urge to remove trade barriers between the countries and
decrease the trade deficit.
The survey respondents expressed their concerns regarding the status of Uighur Muslims in
China, there are expectations that the Chinese government will consider the matter with
utmost importance, allowing them equal rights.BN

resolving the plight of Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar.
An overwhelming number of respondents expressed their positive attitudes toward
bilateral issues about 70per cent of the respondents qualified bilateral relations as either
good or very good.
The visit of China's President Xi Jinping in 2016, the signing of 27 agreements worth several
billions of dollars, the involvement of China in mega projects, pandemic-related
cooperation, cooperation in energy production, zero tariffs for 98 per cent of Bangladeshi
products in the Chinese domestic markets, defence cooperation -all these have positively
impacted in shaping such a positive outlook.
20 per cent of the respondents have also qualified the relationship as a strategic
partnership.
It should be mentioned that China is the only country with which Bangladesh signed
Defence Cooperation Agreement in 2002. China supplied about 75 per cent of Bangladesh's
total arms imports from 2010 to 2019, the survey report said.
Apart from this heavy reliance on China for military equipment, Bangladesh bought the first
ever two Chinese-made Type 035G Ming class submarines from China and built bases with
Chinese assistance.
According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Bangladesh imported
$4,428 million worth of arms and technology between 2000 to 2020 period. Out of this
figure, China remains the largest source of imports for Bangladesh, amounting to 2,886
million, the report said.

In a press release issued on Sunday, the Police Headquarters said it has received
complaints about fraud rings who are identifying themselves as police officers to deceive
and defraud individuals.
Authorities have warned people not to fall victim to such scams and advised verifying the
identity of anyone claiming to be a police officer before engaging with them.
“Legal action against these fraudulent groups is going on. Bangladesh Police remains
committed to ensuring public safety,” the statement said.

BRI projects hold high promises, but the outcome will depend on how Bangladesh plans
and executes these projects
Fahmida Khatun and Sy ed Y usuf Saadat
Update : 07 Dec 2023, 11:46 PM
The Chinese President Xi Jinping launched both the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st
Century Maritime Silk Road initiatives in 2013. Afterwards, these were termed the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI). Also known as the New Silk Road, the BRI is an ambitious infrastructure project
which stretches from East Asia to Europe. 
Publish : 19 No v 2020, 02:05 AM
x25/05/2025, 14:24 OP-ED: How can Bangladesh benefit from the Belt and Road Initiative?
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/230619/op-ed-how-can-bangladesh-benefit-from-the-belt 1/7The initiative’s objective is to build connectivity and cooperation across six main economic
corridors. These are: (1) New Eurasia Land Bridge (NELB); (2) China-Mongolia-Russia (CMR)
Economic Corridor; (3) China-Central Asia-West Asia (CAWA) Economic Corridor; (4) China-
Indochina Peninsula (ICP) Economic Corridor; (5) China-Pakistan (CP) Economic Corridor; (6)
China-Bangladesh-India-Myanmar (BCIM) Economic Corridor.
Through the BRI, China intends to engage in the global economy mainly through investments in
infrastructure. China plans to rebuild the land network connecting China to Europe via Central
Asia (“One Belt”) and the maritime route from China to Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle
East, and Eastern Africa (“One Road”). By the end of July 2019, a total of 136 countries
and 30 international organizations had signed 194 cooperation documents with China to build
a “Belt and Road” cooperation document.
Bangladesh is connected with the BRI through the BCIM economic corridor which was formally
endorsed during the first inter-governmental study group meeting in Kunming held in December
2013. The corridor covers 1.65 million square kilometres, and includes about 440 million people.
It connects China’s Yunnan province, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Kolkata in India through road,
rail, water, and air linkages. 
The BCIM initiative had the ambition to build regional cooperation through building an
economic corridor connecting the sub-regions of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia.
Connectivity through the BCIM economic corridor has the potential to benefit the North East
Indian states through trade with Yunnan province. 
Bangladesh can also benefit through linkages with the North East Indian region and Yunnan.
Moreover, BCIM has the potential for benefiting from the blue economy and international
maritime trade through the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean, and the Andaman and Nicobar
Islands. In order for the BRI to be successful, operationalization of the BCIM is important. 
Recent developments
A number of measures have been rolled out to materialize the ideas embedded in the BRI. During
the visit of the Chinese president to Bangladesh in October 2016, an understanding was reached
regarding implementation of various government to government (G2G) and business to business
(B2B) projects. In total, China promised about $40 billion investment in Bangladesh. An amount
of $24.45bn was in bilateral assistance for infrastructure projects and $13.6bn in joint ventures. In
addition, $20bn in loan agreements was committed. 
x25/05/2025, 14:24 OP-ED: How can Bangladesh benefit from the Belt and Road Initiative?
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/230619/op-ed-how-can-bangladesh-benefit-from-the-belt 2/7In 2016, Bangladesh and China signed eight projects costing more than $9.45bn financed by
China. These include: Padma Bridge rail link worth $3.3bn; the power plant in Payra worth
$1.9bn; digital connectivity worth $1bn, and power grid network strengthening project worth
$1.32bn.     
Bangladesh’s first toll road project was signed on December 6, 2018. The government of
Bangladesh had signed a contract with a China-Bangladesh consortium to upgrade the 48-
kilometre-long Dhaka Bypass Road to a dual carriageway. The objective was to improve
connectivity between the north and northwest parts of Bangladesh and the Chittagong Port. 
This toll road was only one of the many transportation projects which China was investing in
Bangladesh. During the period 2009-2019, China has invested an estimated $9,750mn in various
transportation projects in Bangladesh. 
As part of Bangladesh government’s initiative on establishing Special Economic Zone (SEZ),
Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone (CEIZ) is being developed in Anwara Upazila of
Chittagong district on a land of 783 acres. State-run China Harbour Engineering Company holds
70% share in the joint venture. CEIZ will be the first specialized G2G economic zone. 
Bangladesh’s ties with China 
Bangladesh has increasingly been connected with the Chinese economy through trade,
investment, and cultural exchanges during the last decade or so.  
Investment and financial integration: Due to the rapid pace of growth of the Bangladesh
economy, the infrastructure investment need as a percentage of GDP is expected to fall in the
coming years. However, the difference between the infrastructure investment need and the current
trends of infrastructure investment in Bangladesh is predicted to be more than 1% of GDP. 
Sectoral decomposition of infrastructure investment needs shows that the greatest need for
investment in Bangladesh are in the energy and transport sectors. Predictions show that in 2040,
infrastructure investment needs of the energy and transport sectors will be around 1.5% and 1%
of GDP. The largest proportion of BRI projects in Bangladesh are in the energy and transport
sectors. Thus, BRI has the potential to fill in the infrastructure gaps in Bangladesh.
In fiscal year 2019, Bangladesh witnessed a record high net foreign direct investment (FDI)
inflow of $3,232.89mn between the months of July-March. This surge in FDI was largely driven
x25/05/2025, 14:24 OP-ED: How can Bangladesh benefit from the Belt and Road Initiative?
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/230619/op-ed-how-can-bangladesh-benefit-from-the-belt 3/7by Chinese investment. During the period January-March 2019, Chinese net FDI inflow
amounted to $396.99mn, which was 38.34% of total net FDI inflow into Bangladesh during that
period. In April 2018, Alipay, a concern of China’s e-commerce and tech giant Alibaba Group,
bought 20% stakes in bKash, Bangladesh’s largest mobile financial service provider. 
Trade: China had not been one of the traditional markets for Bangladeshi exports. However,
since the third quarter of 2010, China has become the biggest import partner for Bangladesh,
overtaking the place previously held by India. In 2018, China was the largest trading partner of
Bangladesh with a share of 18.94% of total trade. This was almost double the amount of trade
with India and more than the trade with the US and Germany combined.
Cultural exchange: One of the five components of the BRI is cultural exchange. Through means
of knowledge sharing, research collaboration, and strengthening of people-to-people bonds,
China is expanding cultural exchanges between the countries using the BRI. Since the declaration
of BRI in 2013, there has been a steady increase in the number of Chinese government
scholarships offered to foreign students. 
Since the inception of BRI, the number of Bangladeshi students pursuing higher education in
Chinese universities has grown rapidly over the years. For example, 4,905 more Bangladeshi
students went to study in China in 2016, compared to 2015. Chinese government scholarships are
offering lucrative higher education opportunities to students from Bangladesh. Since the start of
BRI, the number of Confucius institutes all over the world has increased from 440 in 2013 to 548
in 2018. 
On the other hand, the number of Confucius classrooms has increased from 646 in 2013 to 1,193
in 2018. The increase in the demand for learning the Chinese language has been driven not only
through cultural exchange, but also through other components of BRI, such as trade and
investment.
Overcoming the challenges associated with BRI
Debt issue: Sustainable financing of the BRI projects in the participating countries is an
important issue. Chinese government has provided debt relief to countries which have been
suffering from debt distress, on a case-by-case manner. Major official creditors actively
participate in multilateral mechanisms dealing with sovereign defaults, in particular the Paris
Club. 
 x25/05/2025, 14:24 OP-ED: How can Bangladesh benefit from the Belt and Road Initiative?
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/230619/op-ed-how-can-bangladesh-benefit-from-the-belt 4/7China is not a member, but an observer at meetings of the Paris Club. There are several examples
of how China has approached debt issues in various countries. According to the IMF, China was a
creditor to 31 of the 36 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC), and it provided relief in at least
28 of them, including 100% forgiveness for several (for example, Burundi, Afghanistan, and
Guinea). In case of Sri Lanka, China agreed in July 2017 to a debt-for-equity swap for $8nn loan
and a 99-year lease for managing the Hambantota Port.
The external debt of Bangladesh fell from 20% of GDP in 2007 to 15% of GDP in 2015, but rose
again to 17% of GDP in 2018. The absolute amount of outstanding external debt has also
increased from $19354.81mn in 2007 to $33,511.83mn in 2018. Despite the recent trend of
increasing external debt, Bangladesh’s good debt servicing record has ensured that external debt
has not piled up. The total debt service as a percentage of total exports decreased from 8.6% in
2013 to 3.9% in 2018.
Environmental concerns: While the BRI has the potential to bring in positive economic
development, it may cause irreversible damage to the environment as the infrastructure may
threaten the eco-systems and the livelihoods of the people who depend on environmental
resources surrounding them. However, China’s own national sustainability commitments could be
used across the whole of BRI. 
Making its environmental guidelines mandatory overseas, China can improve local standards in
the developing countries where they work. President Xi Jinping’s concept of “ecological
civilization” could contribute to environmental governance. China is developing its green
financing system. The green “One Belt, One Road” demonstrates China’s responsibility for
global ecological security and sustainable development. 
A positive sign is that 58.3% of BRI transport sector construction contracts are in railways, which
are relatively environment-friendly, compared to other modes of transportation.  However,
38.05% of BRI construction contracts in the energy sector are in coal, which is highly damaging
to the environment. Around 56% of China’s total investment in Bangladesh is in the energy
sector, and more precisely -- in coal. Such large investment in coal-based energy sector projects
may have adverse impacts on the environment. BRI is partly responsible for the soaring
investment in renewable energy worldwide. So China could have made more BRI investment in
renewable energy in Bangladesh.
Transparency: Lack of open, transparent, and competitive procurement processes can lead to
poor performance of projects in terms of missing timeline, cost overrun, and low quality services.
The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) score of Transparency International indicates that the
x25/05/2025, 14:24 OP-ED: How can Bangladesh benefit from the Belt and Road Initiative?
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/230619/op-ed-how-can-bangladesh-benefit-from-the-belt 5/7perceived corruption in the Belt and Road corridor economies is higher than the global average
and higher among lower middle and low income countries. Increased transparency in
procurement process and other compliance can benefit BRI projects in terms of co-financing by
other financial sources including the multilateral development agencies.
In response to accusations that it lacked transparency, facilitated corruption, and that some
projects contributed to pollution, a number of initiatives were announced at the 2nd Belt and
Road Forum in Beijing held in April 2019, such as “The Beijing Initiative for Clean Silk Road.”
This initiative calls for international cooperation to promote transparency and integrity, and
combat corruption. The “Green Investment Principles (GIPs) for the Belt and Road” calls for
environment-friendly, climate resilient, and socially inclusive investments under the new BRI
projects. The Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China had published a Debt
Sustainability Framework (DSF) for Participating countries of the BRI in April 2019.  
The way forward for Bangladesh
BRI holds promises to deliver physical and soft infrastructure to foster connectivity and
economic development across its corridors. For Bangladesh too, BRI provides an opportunity to
seize benefits, particularly in areas of trade, investment, connectivity, education, and tourism,
through strong ties with countries particularly in the Southern Asian region, and more
specifically, with China and India. 
The Kunming to Kolkata corridor can reduce costs of transport and benefit Bangladesh through
enhanced trade and investment. This will create opportunities for employment and income.
Bangladesh’s enhanced competitive strength through BRI will help it become better integrated
into the global economy. Bangladesh needs huge resources to build the required transport
infrastructure to be connected with the BCIM corridor.  
Implementation of BRI projects will require trade facilitation reforms. Some of these measures
include standardization and harmonization of procedures and regulations across countries,
improvement of trade facilitation and logistics at the border, cross-border electronic data
exchange, speedy customs clearance, customs cooperation, and measures to ensure security of
people, vehicles, and cargo on the move.  
Vast quantities of resources will need to be mobilized to build the needed transport infrastructure.
Bangladesh has to mobilize domestic resources through tax reform and public-private
partnerships. Selection and planning of BRI projects should be sound, with a full understanding
of the economic and social benefits that will be created through such projects. In order to address
the challenges associated with the BRI projects, the government of Bangladesh should implement

For timely completion of projects and for minimizing cost overrun, public disclosure of BRI
projects’ terms and conditions of finance, monitoring, reporting, and anti-corruption measures
should be in-built in the project implementation mechanism.
Debts should be managed well and debt sustainability issue should be closely monitored in order
to avoid any possible debt traps. For green and clean governance mechanisms in the BRI projects,
financing and environmental information should be disclosed in advance, and on a continuous
basis. 
Social and environmental impact assessments of projects should be done through meaningful and
informed participation and engagement of local people. On the whole, while the BRI projects
hold high promises for economic development, the outcome will be determined by the way
Bangladesh plans and executes these high value projects.

Yunus urges China to reduce interest
rates
Fri Mar 28, 2025 12:00 AM
Last update on: Fri Mar 28, 2025 12:30 AM
Dhaka has reiterated its call for reducing interest rates for Chinese loans from 3
percent to 1-2 percent, while also seeking a waiver on commitment fees for
Chinese-funded projects.
Photo: Collected
The call was made yesterday during Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus's bilateral
meeting with Chinese Executive Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang on the sidelines of
the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference in Hainan.
In yesterday's meeting, Ding said his country would fund modernisation efforts of
the Mongla Port and the Dasherkandi Sewage project and assured Chinese
funding to purchase four ocean-going vessels for Dhaka's state-run Bangladesh
Shipping Corporation.
In a separate meeting with China's Export-Import Bank Chairman Chen Huaiyu,
Bangladeshi officials sought quick disbursement of Exim Bank's funding and
support in new infrastructure projects such as the Dasherkandi Sewage plant.
They also urged the bank to reduce its commitment fees, which raise project
costs.
Chen said his bank would look into the proposals, but also urged Bangladesh to
consider taking on more concessionary loans in renminbi, the Chinese currency.

Yunus’s China visit can open many doors
Bangladesh had made similar requests when Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain
held a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing in
January.
During that visit, Beijing had agreed in principle to extend the repayment period
for Chinese loans and assured of looking into the request to lower the interest
rate.
Asked if China has taken action towards this end, Foreign Secretary Jashim Uddin
said on Tuesday said that there might be an announcement on the matter after
Yunus's bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.
China is Bangladesh's fourth-largest lender after Japan, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank, with total loans disbursed since 1975 coming to $7.5
billion.
During yesterday's meeting with Chinese Executive Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang,
Yunus sought Chinese support in an array of development and livelihood projects
while offering a site for possible relocation of Chinese manufacturing industries.
He reiterated Bangladesh's firm commitment to the One-China policy and said
Dhaka takes pride in being the first South Asian country to join China's Belt and
Road Initiative.
The two leaders agreed to deepen the bilateral relationship between Bangladesh
and China, with Beijing saying it would extend full support to the interim
government of Bangladesh.
They also agreed to boost investment, trade and cultural ties and people-to-
people exchanges as they mark 50 years since the establishment of their
diplomatic relationships.
""President Xi Jinping attaches tremendous importance to your visit,"" Ding said,
adding that China hopes Bangladesh would prosper and grow under the
leadership of Yunus.
He said Beijing will extend duty-free and quota-free access to Bangladeshi goods
to China until 2028, two years after Bangladesh graduates from the least-
developed country bracket to a middle-income economy. Beijing is also keen to
start free trade negotiations with Dhaka, he said.
China last year signed a protocol to import mango from Bangladesh. The mango
export would begin this summer. Beijing would also import jackfruit, guava and
other aquatic products from Bangladesh in its attempt to minimise trade
imbalance, he said.
Bilateral trade stands at $25 billion at present, but Bangladesh's exports to China
are less than $1 billion.
Ding said the Chinese government and its universities would grant more
scholarships to Bangladeshi students.
He said Beijing would foster dialogue between Bangladesh and Myanmar in an
effort to resolve the Rohingya crisis.
Meanwhile, China's EXIM Bank Chairman Chen said his bank would support the
relocation of Chinese manufacturing plants to Bangladesh to use the country as a
platform for export to other nations.
Bangladesh's strategic location and its human resources can transform the
country into a manufacturing hub for top global companies both from China and
elsewhere in the world, Yunus told Chen.
He said the Bangladesh government would offer attractive benefits for the
manufacturers and provide a trade corridor for the Chinese companies.
""Bangladesh can be complementary to China as far as manufacturing is
concerned,"" Yunus said, adding that the interim government is fast-tracking the
construction of a Chinese Special Economic Zone in the Chattogram region.
The country is also building large new ports to serve not only its economy but
also the landlocked countries of Nepal and Bhutan and India's seven northeastern
states.
Chen said Bangladesh is perfectly located to serve both southeastern and far east
Asia and also the Middle East and Western Asia.
More and more Chinese companies are going global, and his bank would support
their investment in Bangladesh and ""develop manufacturing"" in the country.
The bank would also support building infrastructure in Bangladesh to support
the country's socio-economic and sustainable growth.
Chen said Bangladesh needs to improve its business environment to woo
investors from China.
Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain; Energy, Rail and Road Transport Adviser Fouzul
Kabir Khan; High Representative of the Chief Adviser Khalilur Rahman; and BIDA
Executive Chairman Ashiq Chowdhury were present during the meeting.
Yunus also held meetings with former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; Wu
Xiaoling, former vice president of the Central Bank of China; and Alexei
Overchuk, deputy prime minister of Russia.
He sought support and advice from Ban Ki-moon for a smooth transition to
democracy in Bangladesh.

Yunus’ China tour: Trade and investment top priority
Ban Ki-moon said Bangladesh progressed a lot but should have done better
politically and democratically.
Yunus said Bangladesh recently settled a long-pending land issue with the Korean
EPZ in Chattogram, hoping that it would encourage more Korean business people
to invest in Bangladesh.
BIDA Chairman Ashik Chowdhury informed the meeting that Kihak Sung would
lead a 26-member strong business delegation from Korea in the upcoming
Investment Summit in Dhaka.
He also met China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation President Chen
Sichang and discussed a potential second Chinese economic zone in Mongla of
Bagerhat and potential collaboration to employ Bangladeshi workers across the
globe in CCECC-run projects.
During his meeting with FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu, Yunus urged him to
act as a matchmaker between Chinese importers and Bangladesh farm and fruit
producers.
""We need support in fruit processing and vegetable preservation, storage and
packaging. You can connect China with our farmers and exporters,"" Yunus said.
In response, Qu said FAO would take up a new project to export Bangladeshi farm
products to China.

Chinese President Xi Jinping’ s Belt and Road initiative is an extensive infrastructure plan that will link
Asia with the Middle East and Europe, although critics say it is more about spreading Chinese influence.
Japan has taken a cautious stance but has recently shown signs of warming to the initiative.
Kyodo News quoted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as telling a gathering of Japanese and Chinese business
executives this week that he believed “Japan will be able to cooperate well with China.”
Abe met Xi on the sidelines of an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit last month and said the two
had made a “fresh start” to relations between the two nations, which have been plagued by a long-
running territorial dispute over a cluster of East China Sea islets.×25/05/2025, 11:27 Japan to help finance China's Belt and Road projects: Nikkei

Good relations with China are possible even without being part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) deal,

25/05/2025, 11:08 Italy PM says good ties with China possible without Belt and Road
https://bdnews24.com/world/02cb7yx5fa 2/9Italy is the only major W estern country to have joined China's BRI scheme, which envisions rebuilding the
old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with large infrastructure spending.
In an interview with Il Messaggero daily , Meloni said it was too early to anticipate the outcome of Italy's
decision on whether to remain part of the project, which it signed up to in 2019, drawing criticism from
Washington and Brussels.
""Our assessment is very delicate and touches upon many interests,"" said Meloni. The pact expires in
March 2024 and will be automatically renewed unless either side informs the other that they are pulling out,
giving at least three months' notice.
In an interview with Reuters last year , before she won power in a September election, Meloni made clear
she disapproved of the 2019 move, saying she had ""no political will ... to favour Chinese expansion into
Italy or Europe"".
Meloni noted that while Italy was the only one of the Group of Seven (G7) rich democracies to have signed
the Belt and Road memorandum, it was not the European and W estern country with the strongest
economic and trade ties with China.25/05/2025, 11:08 Italy PM says good ties with China possible without Belt and Road
https://bdnews24.com/world/02cb7yx5fa 3/9""This means it is possible to have good relations, also in important areas, with Beijing, without necessarily
these being part of an overall strategic design,"" she said.
Earlier this month a senior Italian government of ficial told Reuters Italy was highly unlikely to renew the Belt
and Road deal.
A first test of the right wing government's attitude towards China looms as Rome vets a shareholder pact at
tyre maker Pirelli's, whose top investor is China's Sinochem.
China is among the biggest markets for most countries in the G7 group, particularly for export-reliant
economies such as Japan and Germany .
At a summit last weekend, G7 leaders pledged to ""de-risk"" without ""decoupling"" from China, an approach
that reflected European and Japanese concerns about pushing Beijing too hard, of ficials and experts said.

Challenges in advancing China-Bangladesh ties

As Chief Adviser Dr. Muhammad Yunus prepares to visit China from March 26 to 28 to attend
the Boao Forum in Hainan, the diplomatic community is closely watching the
developments. This visit comes at a critical juncture for Bangladesh, particularly in the light
of its strained relations with India following the fall of the previous regime. Once hailed as a
model of neighborhood diplomacy, the Indo-Bangladesh relationship has faced significant
challenges, prompting Dhaka to recalibrate its foreign policy priorities. Against thisBN
25/05/2025, 14:14 Challenges in advancing China-Bangladesh ties | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/columns/challenges-in-advancing-china-bangladesh-ties 1/7backdrop, Dr. Yunus's visit to China is seen as a strategic move to strengthen bilateral ties,
which are increasingly centered on trade, development, and geopolitics. However, while
the potential for deepening cooperation is significant, several challenges must be
addressed to ensure a balanced and mutually beneficial partnership.
China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade exceeding $20 billion
annually. However, the trade relationship is heavily skewed in China's favor, with
Bangladesh importing far more than it exports. This imbalance has raised concerns among
Bangladeshi policymakers, who fear that signing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China
by 2026, as Beijing desires, could further undermine the local manufacturing sector. The
government has been cautious about committing to the FTA, wary of the potential influx of
Chinese goods that could stifle domestic industries.
To address the trade gap, China has promised to start importing more Bangladeshi
products, including mangoes and other agricultural goods. While this is a positive step, it
remains to be seen whether such measures will be sufficient to bridge the trade deficit.
Bangladesh must also diversify its export basket and improve product quality to compete in
the Chinese market. The FTA negotiations will require careful handling to ensure that
Bangladesh's economic interests are protected while fostering a more balanced trade
relationship.
China has played a pivotal role in financing and implementing mega infrastructure projects
in Bangladesh, including roads, bridges, and power plants. These projects have been
instrumental in addressing Bangladesh's infrastructure deficit and supporting its economic
growth. However, allegations of inflated project costs during the previous regime have cast
a shadow over this cooperation. Critics argue that some projects were overpriced to benefit
the ruling elite in Bangladesh, raising questions about transparency and accountability.
Moreover, delays in project implementation have been a persistent issue, with both Chinese
and Bangladeshi bureaucracies contributing to the slow progress. While China has agreed
in principle to relax loan repayment terms and extend grace periods, bureaucratic
inefficiencies on both sides continue to hinder timely project completion. Addressing these
challenges will require greater coordination, transparency, and accountability to ensure
that development projects deliver their intended benefits without unnecessary delays or
controversies.
Bangladesh's growing ties with China are being closely monitored by India, a traditional
regional rival of China, as well as by the United States and its allies. As the Indo-Pacific
region becomes a focal point of global geopolitics, Bangladesh finds itself navigating a
complex web of alliances and rivalries. India, in particular, views Bangladesh's deepening
engagement with China with suspicion, given its own strained relations with Beijing. This25/05/2025, 14:14 Challenges in advancing China-Bangladesh ties | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/columns/challenges-in-advancing-china-bangladesh-ties 2/7dynamic complicates Dhaka's efforts to maintain a balanced foreign policy that
accommodates both its neighbors and global powers.
The interim government's reluctance to join China's Global Development Initiative (GDI)
and Global Security Initiative (GSI) underscores the delicate nature of this balancing act.
While these initiatives align with China's broader strategic goals, Bangladesh has opted to
defer its participation until an elected government assumes power. This cautious approach
reflects Dhaka's desire to avoid alienating India and the West while exploring opportunities
for cooperation with China.
China has emerged as Bangladesh's largest supplier of defense equipment, accounting for
a significant share of its military imports. Beijing's offer to further strengthen military ties
presents both opportunities and challenges for Dhaka. On the one hand, closer defense
cooperation could enhance Bangladesh's military capabilities and contribute to regional
stability. On the other hand, it risks provoking concerns among India and other members of
the anti-China bloc, potentially complicating Bangladesh's diplomatic relations.
The interim government must tread carefully in this area, ensuring that its defense
engagements with China do not undermine its broader foreign policy objectives.
Transparency and clear communication with regional partners will be essential to mitigate
any potential fallout from closer military ties with Beijing.
The Rohingya crisis remains one of the most pressing challenges for Bangladesh, with over
a million refugees living in overcrowded camps in Cox's Bazar. China, as a key ally of
Myanmar, wields significant influence over the situation and is seen as a potential mediator
in resolving the crisis. Beijing's support will be crucial in facilitating the repatriation of
Rohingya refugees and addressing the root causes of the conflict in Myanmar's Rakhine
State.
The visit of Dr. Yunus to China provides an opportunity to discuss this issue and seek
Beijing's assistance in finding a sustainable solution.
Recently, China has announced to dedicate major hospitals in Kunming for Bangladeshi
patients. The development took place on the heel of visa curb on Bangladeshis by India as
it has deprived hundreds of Bangladeshi patients in having treatment in Indian hospitals.
China has also pledged to build state of the art hospitals in Bangladesh. All these are seen
as a very positive gesture from the China side. The first batch of the Bangladeshi patients
landed in Kunming on March 10.
If all goes well, this can be a golden opportunity for Bangladeshi patients but there is a
need to address the cost issue. In case it proves too expensive compared to treatment
India, the scheme would fail to reap any dividend.25/05/2025, 14:14 Challenges in advancing China-Bangladesh ties | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/columns/challenges-in-advancing-china-bangladesh-ties 3/7The Teesta River Comprehensive Management Project is another key focus of the chief
adviser's visit. The previous government's decision to exclude China from the project after
lengthy negotiations sparked controversy and raised questions about the transparency of
the decision-making process. With pressure mounting from communities in the Teesta
River basin for a concrete resolution, the interim government must carefully navigate this
sensitive issue.
Re-engaging China in the Teesta project could provide technical and financial support, but
it also risks complicating relations with India, which has its own interests in the river's
water-sharing arrangements. Balancing these competing interests will require skillful
diplomacy and a clear-eyed assessment of Bangladesh's long-term priorities.
As Bangladesh and China prepare to celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations, the
challenges and opportunities in their partnership are more apparent than ever. Chief
Adviser Dr. Yunus's visit to China underscores the importance of the bilateral   relationship
in shaping Bangladesh's economic and geopolitical future. However, advancing bilateral
ties will require addressing trade imbalances, ensuring transparency in development
projects, and navigating the complexities of regional and global geopolitics.
Bangladesh's diplomats must approach these challenges with a clear strategy, balancing
the need for economic cooperation with the imperative of safeguarding national interests.
By fostering a relationship based on mutual respect and shared benefits, Bangladesh and
China can build a partnership that not only strengthens their bilateral ties but also
contributes to regional stability and prosperity. The road ahead is fraught with challenges,
but with careful navigation, the potential for a stronger and more resilient partnership is
within reach.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/377394/chinese-exim-bank-to-support-relocation-of-chinese 1/3Chairman of China's Export-Import Bank Chen Huaiyu said on Thursday that his bank will
support the relocation of Chinese manufacturing plants to Bangladesh to use the country as a
platform for export to other nations.
The Chinese Exim Bank is a key financier of Beijing-funded infrastructure and energy projects in
Bangladesh, but this is the first time it has shown interest in supporting investment from Chinese
private manufacturers in the South Asian country, according to the Chief Adviser's Press Wing.
Chen's comments came when he called on Bangladesh Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus on
the sidelines of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2025 in the Chinese coastal town of
Boao.
Yunus said Bangladesh's strategic location and its human resources can transform the country into
manufacturing hubs for top global companies both from China and elsewhere in the world.
He said he has invited top Chinese private manufacturers to relocate their factories to
Bangladesh, saying his government will offer attractive benefits for the manufacturers and
provide a trade corridor.
""Bangladesh can be complementary to China as far as manufacturing is concerned,"" Professor
Yunus said, adding that the interim government is fast-tracking the construction of a Chinese
special economic zone in the Chittagong region.
Yunus said Bangladesh is also building large new ports to serve not only its economy but also the
landlocked countries of Nepal and Bhutan and India's seven northeastern states.
Chen said Bangladesh is perfectly located to serve both southeastern and far eastern Asia and also
the Middle East and Western Asia.
He said more and more Chinese companies are going global, and his bank will support their
investment in Bangladesh and ""develop manufacturing"" in the country.
He said the bank will also support building infrastructures in Bangladesh to support the country's
socio-economic and sustainable growth.
Citing how Vietnam has transformed its economy by attracting Chinese and Western
manufacturers, Chen said Bangladesh needs to improve its business environment in an effort to
woo investors from China.
""We will learn from Vietnam,"" Yunus said.25/05/2025, 16:39 Chinese Exim Bank to support relocation of Chinese manufacturing plants in Bangladesh

support in new infrastructure projects such as the Dasherkandi Sewage plant. Dhaka also urged
the bank to reduce the bank's commitment fees, which raise project costs.
Chen said his bank will look into these proposals. He also urged Bangladesh to switch to take
more concessionary loans in RMB, the Chinese currency.
Senior officials from both countries are likely to reconvene soon to firm up and take decisive
actions enabling key decisions, which were made in the meeting on Thursday.25/05/2025, 16:39 Chinese Exim Bank to support relocation of Chinese manufacturing plants in Bangladesh

celebrate the 75th founding anniversary of China.
“China and Bangladesh are traditionally friendly neighbours and comprehensive strategic
cooperative partners. Our bilateral relations are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, with full respect to the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of
Bangladesh” he said adding “We believe no one but the Bangladeshi people have the right
to choose their path of development”.
To support the development of Bangladesh, China will unilaterally open its market and
decide to grant zero-tariff treatment on 100 per cent of taxable items to Bangladesh, he
said.
This facility means China will substantially increase the import of cereals, sugar, edible oil,
rubber and rubber products, wood products, jute and jute products, paper and paper
products, wool and cotton from Bangladesh from December 01, 2024, he explained.
“China will also import Bangladeshi fresh mangoes”.
The envoy said to combat the flood, China is about to provide rescue facilities and
equipment to Bangladesh.
“During the last one and half months since the establishment of the interim government,
the Chinese enterprises have invested more than 85 million US dollars, demonstrating the
confidence China holds for the future development of Bangladesh and our relations”.
Next year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Bangladesh.
Referring to this, Mr Wen said, China is looking forward to working closely with Bangladesh
to cement our traditional friendship, deepen friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial
cooperation in various areas, promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, further
advance the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership to a new height.
“Next year is also China-Bangladesh Year of People-to-People Exchanges”.
“We will come out with dozens of functions in the sectors of political exchanges, economic
and trade cooperation, culture, education, tourism, sports, public health, youth, women,
media, academic interactions” he added.

Chinaʼs ʻBelt and Roadʼ plan in Pakistan takes a military

When President Donald Trump started the new year by suspending billions of dollars of security aid to
Pakistan, one theory was that it would scare the Pakistani military into cooperating better with its US
allies.          World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Economy Business Cricket Hello Stripe Recent

The reality was that Pakistan already had a replacement sponsor lined up.
Just two weeks later , the Pakistani air force and Chinese of ficials were putting the final touches on a secret
proposal to expand Pakistan’ s building of Chinese military jets, weaponry and other hardware. TheThe New York Times >>Maria Abi-Habib, The New York Times

25/05/2025, 11:29 China’s ‘Belt and Road’ plan in Pakistan takes a military turn
https://bdnews24.com/world/chinas-belt-and-road-plan-in-pakistan-takes-a-military-turn 2/15confidential plan, reviewed by The New York Times, would also deepen the cooperation between China
and Pakistan in space, a frontier the Pentagon recently said Beijing was trying to militarise after decades of
playing catch-up.
All those military projects were designated as part of China’ s Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion chain of
infrastructure development programs stretching across some 70 countries, built and financed by Beijing.
Chinese of ficials have repeatedly said the Belt and Road is purely an economic project with peaceful intent.
But with its plan for Pakistan, China is for the first time explicitly tying a Belt and Road proposal to its
military ambitions — and confirming the concerns of a host of nations who suspect the infrastructure
initiative is really about helping China project armed might.
As China’ s strategically located and nuclear-armed neighbor , Pakistan has been the leading example of
how the Chinese projects are being used to give Beijing both favor and leverage among its clients.
Since the beginning of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, Pakistan has been the program’ s flagship site,
with some $62 billion in projects planned in the so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor . In the
process, China has lent more and more money to Pakistan at a time of economic desperation there,
binding the two countries ever closer .25/05/2025, 11:29 China’s ‘Belt and Road’ plan in Pakistan takes a military turn
https://bdnews24.com/world/chinas-belt-and-road-plan-in-pakistan-takes-a-military-turn 3/15For the most part, Pakistan has eagerly turned more toward China as the chill with the United States has
deepened. Some Pakistani of ficials are growing concerned about losing sovereignty to their deep-pocketed
Asian ally , but the host of ways the two countries are now bound together may leave Pakistan with little
choice but to go along.
Even before the revelation of the new Chinese-Pakistani military cooperation, some of China’ s biggest
projects in Pakistan had clear strategic implications.
A Chinese-built seaport and special economic zone in the Pakistani town of Gwadar is rooted in trade,
giving China a quicker route to get goods to the Arabian Sea. But it also gives Beijing a strategic card to
play against India and the United States if tensions worsen to the point of naval blockades as the two
powers increasingly confront each other at sea.
A less scrutinized component of Belt and Road is the central role Pakistan plays in China’ s Beidou satellite
navigation system. Pakistan is the only other country that has been granted access to the system’ s military
service, allowing more precise guidance for missiles, ships and aircraft.25/05/2025, 11:29 China’s ‘Belt and Road’ plan in Pakistan takes a military turn
https://bdnews24.com/world/chinas-belt-and-road-plan-in-pakistan-takes-a-military-turn 4/15The cooperation is meant to be a blueprint for Beidou’ s expansion to other Belt and Road nations, however ,
ostensibly ending its clients’  reliance on the US military-run GPS network that Chinese of ficials fear is
monitored and manipulated by the United States.
In Pakistan, China has found an amenable ally with much to recommend it: shared borders and a long
history of cooperation; a hedge in South Asia against India; a large market for arms sales and trade with
potential for growth; a wealth of natural resources.
Now, China is also finding a better showcase for its security and surveillance technology in a place once
defined by its close military relationship with the United States.
“The focus of Belt and Road is on roads and bridges and ports, because those are the concrete
construction projects that people can easily see. But it’ s the technologies of the future and technologies of
future security systems that could be the biggest security threat in the Belt and Road project,” said Priscilla
Moriuchi, director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future, a cyberthreat intelligence monitoring
company based in Massachusetts.
AN ASSET ON THE SEA
The tightening China-Pakistan security alliance has gained momentum on a long road to the Arabian Sea.
In 2015, under Belt and Road, China took a nascent port in the Pakistani coastal town of Gwadar and
supercharged the project with an estimated $800 million development plan that included a large special
economic zone for Chinese companies.
Linking the port to western China would be a new 2,000-mile network of highways and rails through the
most forbidding stretch of Pakistan: Baluchistan province, a resource-rich region plagued by militancy .
The public vision for the project was that it would allow Chinese goods to bypass much longer and more
expensive shipping routes through the Indian Ocean and avoid the territorial waters of several US allies in
Asia.Ad25/05/2025, 11:29 China’s ‘Belt and Road’ plan in Pakistan takes a military turn
https://bdnews24.com/world/chinas-belt-and-road-plan-in-pakistan-takes-a-military-turn 5/15From the beginning, though, key details of the project were kept from the public and lawmakers, of ficials
say, including the terms of its loan structure and the length of the lease, more than 40 years, that a Chinese
state-owned company secured to operate the port.
If there was concern within Pakistan about the hidden costs of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , also
known as CPEC, there was growing suspicion abroad about a hidden military aspect, as well.
In recent years, Chinese state-owned companies have built or begun constructing seaports at strategic
spots around the Indian Ocean, including places in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Malaysia.
Chinese of ficials insisted that the ports would not be militarized. But analysts began wondering whether
China’ s endgame was to muscle its way onto coastal territories that could become prime military assets —
much as it did when it started militarizing contested islands in the South China Sea.
Then, Sri Lanka, unable to repay its ballooning debt with China, handed over the Chinese-built port at
Hambantota in a 99-year lease agreement last year . Indian and American of ficials expressed a growing
conviction that taking control of the port had been China’ s intent all along.
In October , Vice President Mike Pence said Sri Lanka was a warning for all Belt and Road countries that
China was luring them into debt traps.
“China uses so-called debt diplomacy to expand its influence,” Pence said in a speech.
“Just ask Sri Lanka, which took on massive debt to let Chinese state companies build a port of
questionable commercial value,” Pence added. “It may soon become a forward military base for China’ s
growing blue-water navy .”Ad

https://bdnews24.com/world/chinas-belt-and-road-plan-in-pakistan-takes-a-military-turn 6/15Military analysts predict that China could use Gwadar to expand the naval footprint of its attack
submarines, after agreeing in 2015 to sell eight submarines to Pakistan in a deal worth up to $6 billion.
China could use the equipment it sells to the South Asian country to refuel its own submarines, extending
its navy’ s global reach.
DEEPENING DEBT
When China inaugurated Belt and Road, in 2013, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’s new government in
Pakistan saw it as the answer for a host of problems.
Foreign investment in Pakistan was scant, driven away by terrorist attacks and the country’ s enduring
reputation for corruption. And Pakistan desperately needed a modern power grid to help ease persistent
electricity shortages.
Pakistani of ficials say that Beijing first proposed the highway from China’ s western Xinjiang region through
Pakistan that connected to Gwadar port. But Pakistani of ficials insisted that new coal power plants be built.
China agreed.
With CPEC under fresh scrutiny , Chinese and Pakistani of ficials in recent weeks have contended that
Pakistan has a debt problem, but not a Chinese debt problem. In October , the country’ s central bank
revealed an overall debt and liability burden of about $215 billion, with $95 billion externally held. With
nearly half of CPEC’ s projects completed — in terms of worth — Pakistan currently owes China $23 billion.
But the country stands to owe $62 billion to China — before interest balloons the figure to some $90 billion
— under the plan for Belt and Road’ s expansion there in coming years.Ad
Ad25/05/2025, 11:29 China’s ‘Belt and Road’ plan in Pakistan takes a military turn
https://bdnews24.com/world/chinas-belt-and-road-plan-in-pakistan-takes-a-military-turn 7/15Pakistan’ s central bank governor , Ashraf W athra, said publicly in 2015 that he had no clarity on Chinese
investments in Pakistan and was concerned about rising debt levels. It still took him months after that to
secure a briefing from Cabinet of ficials.
“My main question was, ‘Do we have any feasibility studies of these projects and a cost-benefit analysis?’
Their answers were all evasive,” recalled W athra, who has since retired.
Ahsan Iqbal, a Cabinet minister and the main architect for CPEC in the previous government, said the
project was well thought-through and dismissed W athra’ s account.
“No one wanted to invest here — the Chinese took a chance,” Iqbal said in an interview .
But the bill is coming due. Pakistan’ s first debt repayments to China are set for next year , starting at about
$300 million and gradually increasing to reach about $3.2 billion by 2026, according to of ficials. And
Pakistan is already having trouble paying what it owes to Chinese companies.
FIGHTER JETS AND SA TELLITES
According to the undisclosed proposal drawn up by the Pakistani air force and Chinese of ficials at the start
of the year , a special economic zone under CPEC would be created in Pakistan to produce a new
generation of fighter jets. For the first time, navigation systems, radar systems and onboard weapons would
be built jointly by the countries at factories in Pakistan.
The proposal, confirmed by of ficials at the Ministry of Planning and Development, would expand China and
Pakistan’ s current cooperation on the JF-17 fighter jet, which is assembled at Pakistan’ s military-run Kamra
Aeronautical Complex in Punjab province. The Chinese-designed jets have given Pakistan an alternative to
the US-built F-16 fighters.Ad

https://bdnews24.com/world/chinas-belt-and-road-plan-in-pakistan-takes-a-military-turn 8/15The plans are in the final stages of approval, but the current government is expected to rubber-stamp the
project, of ficials in Islamabad say .
For China, Pakistan could become a showcase for other countries seeking to shift their militaries away from
US equipment and toward Chinese arms, W estern diplomats said. And because China is not averse to
selling such advanced weaponry as ballistic missiles — which the United States will not sell to allies like
Saudi Arabia — the deal with Pakistan could be a steppingstone to a bigger market for Chinese weapons in
the Muslim world.
For years, some of the most important military coordination between China and Pakistan has been going
on in space.
Just months before Beijing unveiled the Belt and Road project in 2013, it signed an agreement with
Pakistan to build a network of satellite stations inside the South Asian country to establish the Beidou
Navigation System as an alternative to the American GPS network.
Beidou quickly became a core component of Belt and Road, with the Chinese government calling the
satellite network part of an “information Silk Road” in a 2015 white paper .
Like GPS, Beidou has a civilian function and a military one. If its trial with Pakistan goes well, Beijing could
offer Beidou’ s military service to other countries, creating a bloc of nations whose military actions would be
more dif ficult for the United States to monitor .
By 2020, all 35 satellites for the system will be launched in collaboration with other Belt and Road
countries, completing Beidou.
“Beidou, whatever any users use it for — whether it’ s a civilian navigating their way to the grocery store or
a government using it to coordinate their rocket launches — those are all things that China can track,” said
Moriuchi, of the research group Recorded Future. “And that’ s what is most striking: that this authoritarian
government will be a major technology provider for numerous countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.”Ad

“The PLA  continues to strengthen its military space capabilities despite its public stance against the
militarization of space,” including developing Beidou and new weaponry , according to a Pentagon report
issued to Congress in May , using a common abbreviation for China’ s military .
In October , Pakistan’ s information minister , Fawad Chaudhry , said that by 2022, Pakistan would send its
own astronaut into space with China’ s help.
“We are close to China, and we are getting more close,” he said in a later interview . “It’s time for the W est
to wake up and recognise our importance.”

25/05/2025, 11:38 Trump launched CIA covert influence operation against China
https://bdnews24.com/world/t1odpy9zne 2/12Three former of ficials told Reuters that the CIA  created a small team of operatives who used bogus internet
identities to spread negative narratives about Xi Jinping’ s government while leaking disparaging
intelligence to overseas news outlets. The ef fort, which began in 2019, has not been previously reported.
During the past decade, China has rapidly expanded its global footprint, forging military pacts, trade deals,
and business partnerships with developing nations.
The CIA  team promoted allegations that members of the ruling Communist Party were hiding ill-gotten
money overseas and slammed as corrupt and wasteful China’ s Belt and Road Initiative, which provides
financing for infrastructure projects in the developing world, the sources told Reuters.
Although the US of ficials declined to provide specific details of these operations, they said the disparaging
narratives were based in fact despite being secretly released by intelligence operatives under false cover .
The ef forts within China were intended to foment paranoia among top leaders there, forcing its government
to expend resources chasing intrusions into Beijing’ s tightly controlled internet, two former of ficials said.
“We wanted them chasing ghosts,” one of these former of ficials said.
Chelsea Robinson, a CIA  spokesperson, declined to comment on the existence of the influence
programme, its goals or impacts.25/05/2025, 11:38 Trump launched CIA covert influence operation against China
https://bdnews24.com/world/t1odpy9zne 3/12A spokesperson for China’ s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said news of the CIA  initiative shows the US
government uses the “public opinion space and media platforms as weapons to spread false information
and manipulate international public opinion.”
The CIA  operation came in response to years of aggressive covert ef forts by China aimed at increasing its
global influence, the sources said. During his presidency , Trump pushed a tougher response to China than
had his predecessors. The CIA ’s campaign signaled a return to methods that marked W ashington’ s
struggle with the former Soviet Union. “The Cold W ar is back,” said Tim W einer , author of a book on the
history of political warfare.
Reuters was unable to determine the impact of the secret operations or whether the administration of
President Joe Biden has maintained the CIA  program. Kate W aters, a spokesperson for the Biden
administration’ s National Security Council, declined to comment on the program’ s existence or whether it
remains active. Two intelligence historians told Reuters that when the White House grants the CIA  covert
action authority , through an order known as a presidential finding, it often remains in place across
administrations.
Ad25/05/2025, 11:38 Trump launched CIA covert influence operation against China
https://bdnews24.com/world/t1odpy9zne 4/12Trump, now the Republican frontrunner for president, has suggested he will take an even tougher approach
toward China if re-elected president in November . Spokespeople for Trump and his former national security
advisers, John Bolton and Robert O’Brien, who both served the year the covert action order was signed,
declined to comment.
The operation against Beijing came with significant risk of escalating tensions with the United States, given
the power of China's economy and its ability to retaliate through trade, said Paul Heer , a former senior CIA
analyst on East Asia who learned of the presidential authorization from Reuters. For example, after
Australia called for an investigation inside China probing the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020,
Beijing blocked billions of dollars in Australian trade through agricultural tarif fs.
Trump’ s 2019 order came after years of warnings from the US intelligence community , and media reports,
about how China was using bribery and threats to obtain support from developing countries in geopolitical
disputes as it attempted to sow division in the United States through front groups.
China’ s Foreign Ministry said Beijing follows a “principle of non-interference in the internal af fairs of other
countries and does not interfere in the domestic af fairs of the United States.”
A year earlier , Trump gave the CIA  greater powers to launch of fensive cyber operations against US
adversaries after numerous Russian and Chinese cyber attacks against American organisations, Yahoo
News reported. Reuters could not independently confirm the existence of the earlier order .
Sources described the 2019 authorisation uncovered by Reuters as a more ambitious operation. It enabled
the CIA  to take action not only in China but also in countries around the world where the United States and
China are competing for influence. Four former of ficials said the operation targeted public opinion in
Southeast Asia, Africa and the South Pacific.Ad
Ad25/05/2025, 11:38 Trump launched CIA covert influence operation against China
https://bdnews24.com/world/t1odpy9zne 5/12“The feeling was China was coming at us with steel baseball bats and we were fighting back with wooden
ones,” said a former national security of ficial with direct knowledge of the finding.
Matt Pottinger , a senior National Security Council of ficial at the time, crafted the authorization, three former
officials said. It cited Beijing’ s alleged use of malign influence, allegations of intellectual property theft and
military expansion as threats to US national security , one of those former of ficials said.
Pottinger told Reuters he would not comment on the “accuracy or inaccuracy of allegations about US
intelligence activities,” adding that “it would be incorrect to assume that I would have had knowledge of
specific US intelligence operations.”
Covert messaging allows the United States to implant ideas in countries where censorship might prevent
that information from coming to light, or in areas where audiences wouldn’t give much credence to US
government statements, said Loch Johnson, a University of Georgia political scientist who studies the use
of such tactics.
Covert propaganda campaigns were common during the Cold W ar, when the CIA  planted 80 to 90 articles
a day in an ef fort to undermine the Soviet Union, Johnson said. In the 1950s, for example, the CIA  created
an astrological magazine in East Germany to publish foreboding predictions about communist leaders,
according to declassified records.
The covert propaganda campaign against Beijing could backfire, said Heer , the former CIA  analyst. China
could use evidence of a CIA  influence program to bolster its decades-old accusations of shadowy W estern
subversion, helping Beijing “proselytise” in a developing world already deeply suspicious of W ashington.Ad
Ad25/05/2025, 11:38 Trump launched CIA covert influence operation against China
https://bdnews24.com/world/t1odpy9zne 6/12The message would be: “‘Look at the United States intervening in the internal af fairs of other countries and
rejecting the principles of peaceful coexistence,’” Heer said. “And there are places in the world where that
is going to be a resonant message.”
US influence operations also risk endangering dissidents, opposition groups critical of China and
independent journalists, who could be falsely painted as CIA  assets, said Thomas Rid, a professor at Johns
Hopkins University who wrote a book on the history of political warfare.

'China-Bangladesh relations have
become the model of friendship between
countries with different social systems
and different cultures'
Thu Jul 19, 2012 12:00 AM
Last update on: Thu Jul 19, 2012 12:00 AM
His Excellency Li Jun
China's new ambassador to Bangladesh, Li Jun, arrived in Dhaka on February
18 and presented his credentials to the President on March 6. In an exclusive
interview with The Daily Star's Diplomatic Correspondent Rezaul Karim
recently, he talked on a wide range of bilateral issues. He said he would try his
best and cooperate with the government and people of Bangladesh to improve
further the ties between the two countries. He also said China and Bangladesh
are good neighbours. Since 1975, the bilateral relationship has always been
developing in a smooth manner an d bilateral cooperation in various areas has
been deepened. Following are excerpts from the interview.
The Daily Star (TDS): As the new Chinese Ambassador in Bangladesh, what are
the priorities you plan to emphasise during your assignment in this country?
Li Jun (L J): In March and June 2010, H.E. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of
Bangladesh, and H.E. Xi Jinping, Vice President of China, had a successful
exchange of visits. The two sides issued a Joint Statement and decided to establish
and develop a ""Closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation"" between China
and Bangladesh from the strategic perspective and on the basis of the principles
of longstanding friendship, equality and mutual benefit. I believe this set the
direction of and provided the guidelines for the development of our bilateral
relationship.
During my tenure,
* I will do my utmost to consolidate and develop the bilateral relationship with
the aim of promoting the development of our two countries and the welfare of
our two peoples;
* I will continue to push for more exchanges of high-level visits and contacts and
friendly exchanges between government agencies, parliaments, political parties,
and non-governmental organisations of our two countries;
* I will continue to push for intensified cooperation in trade, investment,
agriculture, transportation and infrastructure development on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit;
* I will continue to push for a further widening of people-to-people and cultural
exchanges and cooperation with a view to promoting mutual understanding and
friendship between the two peoples;
* I will continue to push for strengthened exchanges and cooperation between
the militaries and law enforcement departments to safeguard respective national
security and stability and promote peace and stability in the region;
* I will continue to push for closer coordination and cooperation to uphold the
common interests of the two countries as well as that of the developing countries
in international and regional affairs, such as climate change, energy and food
security.
I am confident that with the joint efforts of our two countries, the closer
comprehensive partnership of cooperation between China and Bangladesh will
be brought to a new high and bring tangible benefits for our two peoples.
TDS: Bangladesh and China enjoy excellent bilateral relations. How do you
foresee these relations developing further in the days ahead?
L J: The traditional friendship between our two peoples date back to over two
thousand years ago. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1975,
China-Bangladesh ties have been developing in a smooth manner and the
pragmatic cooperation in various fields has been further strengthened. It was the
efforts that successive governments and the peoples of our two countries have
made that contributed to the enhancement of China-Bangladesh friendship. To
them I pay my tributes.
Currently, the development of relations between China and Bangladesh enjoys the
right time, right place, and right people. China is implementing the 12th Five Year
Plan with scientific development as guidance and transforming economic growth
pattern as the main objective. At the same time, Bangladesh is pushing forward
the ""Digital Bangladesh"" and ""Vision 2012."" Our development strategies have
provided us great scope for cooperation. China and Bangladesh are close
neighbours, the region where we are situated has been experiencing rapid
growth, which created more opportunities for regional and international
cooperation. Apart from that, our bilateral relationship has neither problems left
from history, nor conflicts of interest at present. Compassion, understanding,
support, and mutual-assistance have always been the main theme of our
relationship.
I am convinced that the traditional friendship between China Bangladesh and
mutually beneficial cooperation will better contribute to the development of the
two countries and benefit the two peoples.
TDS: What are the major follow-up events after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
visit to China in March 2010?
L J: In March and June 2010, H.E. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh
and H.E. Xi Jinping, Vice President of China had an exchange of visits to each
other's countries. The two sides decided to establish a ""Closer Comprehensive
Partnership of Cooperation"" from the strategic perspective and on the basis of the
principles of longstanding friendship, equality, and mutual benefit. A Joint
Statement was also issued which reflected the consensus reached by leaders of
both countries to further consolidate and develop China-Bangladesh relationship.
Since then, there have been positive developments in bilateral relationship. There
have been constant exchanges of high-level visits between the two countries. The
Speaker of Bangladesh Parliament Abdul Hamid and Foreign Minister Dipu Moni,
as well as many ministers, have visited China. Liu Qi, Member of Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China (CPC) and Secretary of
CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, Qin Guangrong, Governor of Yunnan Province
of China as well as other high level officials visited Bangladesh.
There has been much progress in bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
Bilateral trade volume in 2011 reached $8.26 billion, with an increase of 17%
compared with 2010. Bangladeshi export to China reached $449 million, an
increase of 67.5%. According to local news reports, Chinese investment in
Bangladesh in 2011 amounted to over $200 million. The agreements on
introduction of 3G technology and expansion of 2.5G network, and on Shajhalal
fertilizer factory project were signed. The construction work will start very soon.
China also exempted debts of Bangladesh worth more than 600 million RMB.
There also have been positive developments in bilateral cultural exchanges. In
November 2011, Beijing Night Art Performance and Charming Beijing Photo
Exhibition were successfully held in Dhaka. Fantastic performances of the
Chinese artists and beautiful pictures of Beijing deepened Bangladeshi people's
understanding towards China. ""Happy Chinese New Year"" cultural events have
become a fam ous Chinese cultural brand in Bangladesh. Every year, Dhaka
citizens flock to the theater to enjoy the exciting moments of traditional Chinese
New Year.
In addition, there has been big progress also in other areas such as agriculture,
education, military, etc. I will continue to push forward the all-dimensional
cooperation in various fields between our two countries.
TDS: During the PM's visit to Beijing, Bangladesh and China agreed to
strengthen cooperation in the military and law enforcement areas at various
levels. Is there any progress in those fiends?
L J: Military cooperation is an important part of the all-dimensional cooperation
between China and Bangladesh. In the Joint Statement issued during Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to China in March 2010, the two sides agreed to
strengthen exchanges and cooperation between the militaries and law
enforcement departments to safeguard respective national security and stability
and promote peace and stability in the region. Military cooperation between
China and Bangladesh strictly adheres to relevant international law and norms on
international relations, and is not against any third party. In 2011, there was
successful cooperation between the two countries in this regard. Air Chief
Marshal Ma Xiaotian, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of People's Liberation
Army and Vice Admiral Ding Yiping, Deputy Commander of Navy of People's
Liberation Army visited Bangladesh with big success. General Mubin, Chief of
Army Staff of Bangladesh paid a visit to China, which was fruitful. I believe this
tendency of friendly cooperation will be maintained and further developed.
TDS: How do you evaluate China-Bangladesh relations under the present
Awami League-led grand alliance government in comparison to ties under
previous governments?
L J: The friendship between China and Bangladesh is a genuine and time-tested
one. No matter which party is in power, this bilateral relationship maintains the
tendency of moving forward. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in
1975, successive governments of Bangladesh have been making important
contributions to the development of the bilateral relationship. China-Bangladesh
relations have become the model of friendship between countries with different
social systems and different cultures.
During the tenure of current government under the leadership of H.E. Sheikh
Hasina, China-Bangladesh relations have witnessed considerable development,
and the all-dimensional cooperation between the two countries has been
continuously strengthened. Presently, China-Bangladesh relations are standing at
a new starting point, facing unprecedented historic opportunities. The Chinese
side stands ready to closely work with the Bangladesh side to further enrich the
closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation, strengthen the existing
bilateral cooperation in different fields, and enhance the friendship between the
two peoples.
TDS: Strategically, how does China see Bangladesh in the geo-political equation
in the region?
L J: China adheres to the foreign policy of ""building friendship and partnership
with the neighboring countries,"" and would like to establish and maintain good-
neighbourly relations with all its neighbouring countries. China attaches
importance to the important role of Bangladesh in maintaining peace, stability
and development of South Asia. China is willing to join hands with Bangladesh
and further promote the closer Comprehensive Cooperative Partnership between
the two countries.
TDS: The cabinet recently approved the draft of Sonadia Deep Seaport
Authority Act. Is there any development from the Chinese side about
construction of the deep seaport at Sonadia in Chittagong?
L J: The deep seaport in Sonadia Island is of strategic importance to Bangladesh
and will be helpful in enabling Bangladesh to become the regional transportation
and logistics centre. Chinese enterprises have advanced technologies,
equipments and ample funds. Over the years, China Harbour Engineering
Company Ltd has accumulated rich experience in this regard. Presently, this
company has established an office in Dhaka and stands ready to participate in
this project in a commercial manner. Chinese enterprises are also ready to
cooperate with enterprises from other countries to jointly take part in this
project. So long as the Bangladeshi side shows enough will and determination,
this project can make positive progress very soon.
TDS: How can China cooperate with Bangladesh in tackling the impact of
climate change in Bangladesh?
L J: As a country most vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh has been
experiencing sufferings caused by climate change. China fully understands and
respects the concerns of Bangladesh over it. During international negotiations on
climate change, China has always been supporting the legitimate and reasonable
requests of Bangladesh and the Least Developed Countries as a whole. As
developing countries, China and Bangladesh should stick to the principle of
""common but differentiated responsibilities"" and work together to safeguard the
common interests of developing countries.
China and Bangladesh are both victims of climate change. On this issue, the two
countries face the same challenges and our basic interests are the same. Over the
years, China has already carried out cooperation with Bangladesh in the area of
adaptation. For example, China helped Bangladesh in projects of river dredging.
The Chinese Government provided relevant training for Bangladeshi officials and
technicians. China will continue to strengthen the cooperation with Bangladesh
in this regard on the basis of ""equal consultation, mutual benefit and common
development"". China will continue to support the capacity building to help
Bangladesh better resist the adverse effects of climate change. Relevant
government institutions of the two countries can have detailed discussions.
TDS: Is there any progress in the construction of the 8th Friendship Bridge (2nd
Meghna Bridge) and Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Centre?
L J: Consultations are going on between our two countries concerning the 8th
Friendship Bridge. I believe there will be a positive result soon. As for the China-
Bangladesh Friendship Exhibition Centre, we noticed some news reports saying
that the Bangladeshi government has decided to build this Centre at Purbachal.
We would be very happy to get the confirmation from and work with the
Bangladeshi side so that concrete progress can be made concerning this project.
TDS: Would you be willing to provide assistance to Bangladesh in launching a
communication and remote sensing satellite into orbit in the near future?
L J: China is willing to provide assistance to Bangladesh in launching a satellite.
This has been reflected in the Joint Statement issued by the two countries during
the visit of Her Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to China in March
2010. The two sides can have further consultations in this regard.
TDS: Will you provide assistance for the dredging of riverbeds and for capacity
building through training of personnel?
L J: Bangladesh is a country with a large number of rivers. River dredging is
essential to the livelihood of Bangladesh people and the development of this
country. Against the backdrop of global climate change, river dredging becomes
even more important. China understands the need of Bangladesh and always tries
to extend its help. Each year, the Chinese government provides relevant training
courses for Bangladeshi government official and technicians. Besides, the
Chinese government strongly supports qualified Chinese enterprises to take part
in dredging projects. In September 2011, China Harbour Engineering Company
Ltd was selected to implement a project for Jamuna River dredging (14
kilometers). China will continue to provide its support at the request of
Bangladeshi government.",0.143263289,0.387477861,,Positive

China for advancing bilateral ties with
Bangladesh: W ang Yi
Tue Jan 21, 2025 09:02 PM
Last update on: Tue Jan 21, 2025 09:05 PM
Beijing is willing to work with Bangladesh to deepen friendship, strengthen
strategic communication and advance comprehensive strategic cooperative
partnership, said China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi today.
China is also willing to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation to further
advance bilateral ties, he told Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain during a meeting
in Beijing.
""China has always prioritised Bangladesh in its neighbourhood diplomacy and
adheres to a good-neighbour policy toward all Bangladeshi people,"" reports China
Daily quoting Wang.
Touhid Hossain arrived in Beijing Monday night for a four-day visit. This is his
first visit to China at the invitation of the Chinese foreign minister.
The fact that Hossain made China the destination of his first trip overseas after
assuming office reflects the great importance that the interim government of
Bangladesh attaches to China-Bangladesh relations, Wang said.
He said the mordernisation and reform drives in China will offer new
opportunities for countries worldwide.
Bangladesh was the first South Asian country to sign a memorandum of
understanding on Belt and Road cooperation with China.
Wang called on the two countries to coordinate efforts to implement major
landmark projects and ""small but beautiful"" livelihood programmes. He also
urged for consolidating traditional cooperation while exploring new emerging
areas.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties
between China and Bangladesh, as well as the China-Bangladesh Year of Cultural
Exchange.
Hossain said there is a cross-party consensus on the friendship with China. It has
been supported by successive governments and the people of the country also
want to strengthen the ties.
He thanked China for supporting Bangladesh in safeguarding its independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity while pledging the country's firm adherence
to the one-China principle.
Hossain also expressed gratitude for China's long-term selfless support for
Bangladesh's development, bringing about tangible benefits to its people.
Bangladesh is willing to engage in mutual support with China in international
forums, strengthen coordination in regional affairs, act as partners in promoting
connectivity and regional economic integration, and jointly safeguard
international fairness and justice, he said.",0.118897306,0.350028058,,Positive

Last update on: Mon Nov 14, 2022 01:37 AM
This article, on the key takeaways from the CPC 20th National Congress, is the second of a
two-part series.
""No man ever steps in the same river twice,"" said Heraclitus, the ancient Greek
philosopher, in explaining the unity of opposites. The notion of modernisation
serves a perfect argument in this regard: all nations share a common vision for
Military delegates arrive before the opening ceremony of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, at

modernisation, but have to follow different pathways to achieve it. Learning from
lessons and experience of other modernised nations notwithstanding, China, as a
country unique in population, culture, history, social system and many other
senses, cannot simply transplant any others' paradigm, but has to set the criteria
and fix the road map that suit but only its own case.
Based on exploration and practice since the founding of the People's Republic of
China, in particular the breakthroughs in theory and practice since 2012 when
socialism with Chinese characteristics entered a new era, the Communist Party of
China (CPC) has led the country to blaze an indigenous trail to achieve
modernisation, which is, for the first time, comprehensively expounded by the
newly concluded 20th National Congress of the CPC. It contains elements
common to the modernisation processes of all countries, but is characterised by
features unique to the Chinese context.
Read mo re
A New Journey for China
First, it is the modernisation of a huge population. China is working to achieve
modernisation for more than 1.4 billion people, a number larger than the
combined population of all developed countries in the world today. This is a task
of unparalleled difficulty and complexity that inevitably labels our pathways of
development and methods of advancement with uniqueness.
Second, it is the modernisation of common prosperity for all. Achieving common
prosperity is a defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and
involves a long historical process. The immutable goal of our modernisation drive
is to meet the people's aspirations for a better life. We will endeavour to maintain
and promote social fairness and justice, bring prosperity to all, and prevent
polarisation.
Third, it is the modernisation of material and cultural-ethical advancement.
Material want is not socialism, nor is cultural impoverishment. China inherited a
splendid cultural heritage brewed throughout its history lasting for millennia,
thus is naturally entitled to the right of well-rounded development in both
material and cultural-ethical terms. By advancing its culture in a socialist way,
China will create a new form of human advancement.
Fourth, it is the modernisation of harmony between humanity and nature. China
is committed to sustainable development and to the principles of conserving and
preserving resources, protecting the environment and letting nature restore
itself. The country will continue to pursue a model of sound development
featuring improved production, higher living standards, and healthy ecosystems
to ensure sustainable development.
With utmost importance, it is the modernisation of peaceful development. In
pursuing modernisation, China will not tread the old path of war, colonisation,
and plunder taken by some countries. That brutal and blood-stained path of
enrichment at the expense of others caused great suffering for the people of
developing countries. In the course of its peaceful rise, China pledges to stand
firmly on the right side of history for world peace, joint development and human
progress.
To realise the aforementioned visions, the congress re-emphasises a two-step
strategic plan. From 2020 through 2035, China will significantly increase its
composite national strength, substantially grow the per capita GDP to be on par
with that of a mid-level developed country, and basically realise socialist
modernisation. Then from 2035 through the middle of this century, China will
become a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic,
culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful, leading the world in terms of
composite national strength and international influence.
The five years ahead will be crucial for China getting our efforts to a good start,
whereas the world has entered a new period of turbulence and change in which
strategic opportunities, risks, and challenges are concurrent, and uncertainties
and unforeseen factors are rising. To guarantee the achievement of Chinese
modernisation, it is essential for China to uphold and strengthen the overall
leadership by the CPC, and to keep following the path of socialism with Chinese
characteristics. We will apply a people-centred development philosophy, and
remain committed to reform and opening up. Meanwhile, to meet obstacles and
difficulties head on, China needs to carry forward a fighting spirit.

China-Bangladesh relations stronger than ever before
While pursuing modernisation on our own path, we also observe with admiration
that Bangladesh spends no effort in exploring its own way towards
modernisation. Under the able leadership of the honourable Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina and with joint efforts of all Bangladeshi people, the country has
grown from a boat to a cruise. It is now the second largest economy in South Asia,
and is expected to become the ninth largest consumer market within a decade.
Bangladesh has impressed the world by its steady and fast growth. A bright and
promising future lies ahead of the pearl of the Bay of Bengal.
As Chinese President Xi says, the dream of Sonar Bangla well connects with the
Chinese dream of rejuvenation. At operational level, Bangladesh's development
strategies, such as the Vision 2041 perspective plan, are synergising closely with
the Belt and Road Initiative. More opportunities of cooperation on achieving the
2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are being explored by us both, under
the Global Development Initiative. It is my deep belief that, in our respective but
joint struggles in pursuing modernisation and realising national dreams, China
and Bangladesh would work as the closest friends and sincerest partners to
promote the humanity's shared values of peace, development, fairness, justice,
democracy, and freedom, to address global challenges and to continue building a
community with a shared future for mankind.

https://bdnews24.com/economy/chinas-bri-debt-trap-raises-concerns-among-bangladesh-india-experts 2/11Prof Sachin Chaturvedi, director general of India’ s Research and Information System for Developing
Countries (RIS), also shared the “inherent flaws of and concerns” about the BRI which he saw as an
“alternative development cooperation” model.
But he said, in practice countries “often fail to negotiate a good contract that respects their own
development priorities and get trapped in the undisclosed and opaque terms of engagement"".
Chinese expert Prof Cheng Min of the Institute for Bangladesh Studies of the Yunnan Academy of Social
Science, Kunming, however , said the BRI has provided “good conditions” for the establishment of the
China-Bangladesh free trade area.
“On this basis, China and Bangladesh still need to make continuous ef forts to take positive measures,” she
said.
Bangladesh joined the BRI during Chinese President Xi Jinping’ s visit to Dhaka in 2016. The initiative aims
to rebuild the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond through massive infrastructural
spending.×          World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Economy Business Cricket Hello Stripe Recent25/05/2025, 10:56 China’s BRI 'debt trap' raises concerns among Bangladesh, India experts
https://bdnews24.com/economy/chinas-bri-debt-trap-raises-concerns-among-bangladesh-india-experts 3/11However , the initiative has been the subject of controversy in many western capitals, particularly
Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and trap countries into
debt through “nontransparent” projects.
India did not join the BRI, citing concerns over China’ s projects with Pakistan. Some analysts say India is
not comfortable with Bangladesh’ s participation in the initiative.
Industries Minister Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun said BRI is “significant” for Bangladesh which he said
has “multidimensional economic ties with China”.
He termed it an “emerging opportunity” and said “lots of ef ficient activities” are needed to seize that
opportunity .
“We have to ensure win-win cooperation with China and other countries,” he said.

The BRI promises to deliver physical and soft infrastructure to foster connectivity and economic
development across its corridor .
The two-way trade between Bangladesh and China is $16.4 billion in 2017, with an average annual growth
rate of about 20 percent since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1975.
It is heavily in favour of China. China's direct investment in Bangladesh was $228 million in 2018.
Through the BRI, China intends to engage in the global economy mainly through investments in
infrastructure.
A number of measures have been rolled out to materialise the ideas in Bangladesh. During his visit to
Bangladesh, President Xi promised about $40 billion investment in Bangladesh - $24.45 in bilateral
assistance for infrastructure projects and $13.6 billion in joint ventures.
In addition, $20 billion in loan arrangements was committed.
Foreign Secretary Md Shahidul Haque said Bangladesh has not confined itself to BRI only .
“We are looking beyond,” he said, referring to Bangladesh’ s joining the W ashington’ s Indo-Pacific Strategy
in this region.
He said Bangladesh will be joining to all initiatives “as long as it serves our interest”.Ad

for the national interest. Nothing else, nothing else would determine our negotiation technique”.
INDIA ’S CONCERNS
The Indian expert, Prof Chaturvedi, highlighted the flaws and concerns of the initiative.
“BRI is being viewed as a development initiative as participating countries are benefiting from investments
by China in infrastructure projects,” he said.
But the “scepticism towards the projects, motivations and intents in the BRI countries’  continues,” he said.
“Partner countries often bring in issues like transparency in BRI projects; projects do not factor
environmental aspects; local labour is not employed in project construction, operations and other work; etc.
“Further , lack of local participation, lack of inclusivity , lack of economic and project viability and increased
risk of debt hangovers are manifestations of the inherent gaps in BRI.
“Local resistance to BRI projects in partner countries in worrisome. For instance, Myanmar is willing to
scale down the Kyaukpyu Port over concerns over mounting debt.
“Likewise, there were protests over local employment in Thailand and Lao PDR in the high speed rail
project.
“Sri Lanka’ s disappointment with Hambantota Port is widespread now . This has perhaps the reason that led
Sri Lanka to invite India and Japan for joint development of Colombo Port,” he said.Ad

challenges associated with BRI and Chinese influence in ASEAN.
“Malaysia postponing certain BRI projects in 2018 and later negotiating with China signify the problem of
unilateral conceptualization of development projects.”
WAY FOR WARD FOR BANGLADESH
Fahmida of CPD said for Bangladesh, BRI provides opportunity to seize benefits, particularly in the areas
of trade, investment, connectivity , education and tourism, through strong ties with countries particularly in
the Southern Asian region, more specifically , with China and India.
“Realisation of the BRI objectives will also help Bangladesh in achieving the SDGs,” she said.
But for implementation of BRI projects, she said, Bangladesh will require trade facilitation reforms.
Bangladesh has to mobilise domestic resources through tax reform and public-private partnership.
“Selection and planning of BRI projects should be sound with a full understanding of the economic and
social benefits that will be created though such projects,” she said.
“For timely completion of projects and minimise cost overrun, public disclosure of BRI projects, terms and
conditions of project finance, and monitoring, reporting and anti-corruption measures should be in-built in
the project implementation mechanism”.

35th anniversary of Bangladesh-China diplomatic ties _ The Daily Star (2).pdf,"35th anniversary of Bangladesh-China
diplomatic ties
Wed Oct 20, 2010 12:00 AM
Last update on: Wed Oct 20, 2010 12:00 AM
Bangladesh-China friendship conference centre, Dhaka.
The 35th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Bangladesh and China was
observed on October 4, this year. In 1975 on this date, China opened its
diplomatic mission in Bangladesh
Relationship with China has become one of the priorities of successive
Bangladesh governments. The heads of government of Bangladesh, irrespective
of their political affiliations, invariably visited China and met with top Chinese
leaders to strengthen relations in every possible sector.
Both nations seek a modern partnership based on common interests in meeting
the major challenges of the 21st century.
Bangladesh's relation with China has taken a multi-faceted direction since its
inception. Relations with China are not confined only to state-to-state basis.
China is interested in developing party-to-party relations and, during early March
of this year, a Communist Party delegation's short trip to Dhaka to meet officials
of mainstream political parties demonstrated this fact.
China has assisted Bangladesh in infrastructure, power -- including hydro-power -
- coal mining, setting up industrial plants, telecommunications, flood control,
disaster prevention, river training, irrigation and water resources utilisation.
The visit by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in March this year, and
that of the China's Vice President Xi Jinping to Dhaka in June (he has been
anointed as the likely successor to President Hu Jintao as party chief in 2012) are
evidence of the strength of the economic and political connections between
Bangladesh and China. It has set the scene for greater understanding between the
two countries.
A large portion of our country's infrastructural development, including roads and
bridges, power plants, mining and industrial establishments were built with
Chinese assistance and technology.
China built six bridges in the country. The 4.8 kilometer long Mukhterpur Bridge
over the river Dhaleswari, built by China Road and Bridge Corporation, was
inaugurated on February 18, 2008.
All the bridges have contributed to the accelerated socio-economic growth of the
country, besides facilitating the movement of people and goods within the length
and breadth of the country.
During the visit of the Bangladesh prime minister in March 17-21, China signed
Letters of Exchange on construction of the seventh Bangladesh-China Friendship
Bridge at Kajirtek of Madaripur. China agreed to intensify efforts for the early
start of the second Meghna Bridge and the construction of Bangladesh-China
Friendship Exhibition Centre.
By 2009 China's direct investment in Bangladesh had reached $88 million -- much
higher than the previous two years -- and in 2010, there are about 186 Chinese
enterprises with a registered capital of $320 million in Bangladesh.
Over the past few years, China has replaced India as Bangladesh's biggest trading
partner with bilateral trade between the two nations, as of 2009, standing at $4.58
billion -- though heavily skewed in favour of Beijing with Bangladesh imports
being $4.4 billion.
This year, China offered duty-free access to some 5,000 Bangladeshi products as a
""goodwill gesture"" in a significant development in economic ties between the two
countries. The products include medicinal materials, plastic appliances, leather,
timber, textile, readymade garments and poultry products.
China has provided 40 million Yuan as grant under an economic cooperation
agreement. According to China, although the sum of money provided to
Bangladesh is not the largest among all development partners, they put emphasis
on the actual result of the assistance and whether such assistance can bring
about concrete good to Bangladesh people.
Furthermore, two agreements were concluded -- one for Shahjalal Fertiliser
Factory and another for the establishment of 2.5 3G telecommunication project.
China has agreed to extend its cooperation in agriculture under the MoU of 2005
in areas of hybrid rice, cultivation technology, rice seed technology, agricultural
machinery technology, exchange of germ plasma resources of crops, farm
products processing and technical personnel training. Furthermore, both sides
will explore specific ways and means of expanding agricultural cooperation.
China agreed to increase the number of scholarships to Bangladeshi students
from 80 to 150 within the next three years.
China's help is necessary in Bangladesh's efforts to mitigate the severe effects of
climate change in the shape of floods and other natural calamities. In river
training and dredging China has an enormous reservoir of know-how, which it
can share with Bangladesh.
Future Cooperation with China may be explored in the following areas:
-Water resource management;
-Renewable use energy -- solar, wind power and biomass;
-Interconnectivity through multi-modal transport between Bangladesh and
China;
-Assistance to help build Bangladesh's deep sea port near Cox's Bazar;
-Chinese direct investment in Bangladesh and establishment of an exclusive EPZ
for China;
-Shifting of low-end industries to Bangladesh from China, (such garments and
leather);
-Maritime security.
A study by an international group, the Strategic Foresight Group, under the
heading ""The Himalayan Challenge -- Water Security in Emerging in Asia,""
released on June 28, says that over 200 dams are to be built by China and India on
the Himalayan rivers Yangtze, Brahmaputra and the Ganges to meet their water
needs.
The study states that building such dams will alter the flow of Bangladesh rivers
in the dry season. A decrease in water supply by up to 22% in the next two
decades, rise in sea level, and increase in population may threaten Bangladesh
with the risks of food insecurity, outbreak of water-borne diseases and loss of bio-
diversity.
In our part of the region, a Himalayan River Commission may be set up with
China, Nepal, India and Bangladesh to work together to facilitate basin-wide
development to avoid conflicts among states.
The two countries share many of the challenges that will shape the region in the
years ahead. Likewise there are avenues for collaboration to take advantage of
opportunities that will unfold with the 21st century. It is clear that both nations
can and should do more together.
In my view, Bangladesh's relationship with China ought to be a truly modern
partnership, one that is practical, open and engaged on the global challenges that
face both nations. I am confident that this is an aspiration that people of both
countries share.

China's foreign policy has emerged as a three-pronged multidimensional framework
anchored by three ambitious global initiatives: the Global Development Initiative, the
Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilisational Initiative. These strategic
frameworks aim at reshaping global governance by strengthening China's political,
economic, and cultural influence across the continents. With its strategic location at theBN
25/05/2025, 11:42 China's global strategies and Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/chinas-global-strategies-and-bangladesh 1/12crossroads of key maritime and trade routes, Bangladesh is a rising South Asian economy
that will play a crucial role in Beijing's global agenda.
Bangladesh's balancing between China and India places it at the heart of a complex
geopolitical matrix. The country's growing economy, its expanding trade networks, and the
high needs for development are in tune with China's regional ambitions. However, this
growing engagement is poised to provoke some pretty strong reactions from India, a
regional power uneasy about China's rising presence in its neighbourhood. This article
explores some of the strategic interests accompanying China's global overtures, their
implications for its developing relations with Bangladesh, and India's concerns against the
South Asian geopolitical landscape.
Global Development Initiative (GDI): The GDI was proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping
in 2021 to achieve sustainable development through economic partnership. It closely aligns
with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals but with a peculiar Chinese approach that
highlights South-South cooperation. The core pillars of the initiative include poverty
reduction, food security, education, healthcare, and green development.
China's strategic objectives behind the GDI are to: Expand Economic Influence. Strengthen
economic interdependency through the development of various infrastructure, energy, and
logistics projects.
Build Trade Corridors: Acquire trade routes via developing countries like Bangladesh to gain
unhindered access to global supply chains.
Counter Western Dominance: Offer a counter to existing Western-dominated structures and
programs for economic development, like those proposed by the World Bank and IMF.
Impact on Bangladesh: Bangladesh will benefit economically from greater Chinese
investment in its infrastructure, such as ports, railways, and energy projects. The
involvement of China might accelerate the industrialisation and sustainable development
of Bangladesh. Heavy reliance on Chinese funding could raise questions over debt
sustainability, just as it has over other BRI projects.
Strategic Rivalry: Maintaining Balance of Power in the Region
India has traditionally seen China's growing footprint in South Asia, especially in
Bangladesh, as a direct challenge to its regional dominance. The BRI, together with the
development of ports like Payra and Chittagong, indicates a strategic aim at consolidation
in the Bay of Bengal. India views this expansion as part of the ""String of Pearls"" strategy by
China to encircle India through a network of strategically located ports and infrastructure.
For example, as Bangladesh builds deeper economic and defence links with China, India25/05/2025, 11:42 China's global strategies and Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/chinas-global-strategies-and-bangladesh 2/12can be expected to further bolster its own strategic outreach into the region by
strengthening military-to-military relations with neighbours including Myanmar and Sri
Lanka. This is fast evolving into an intricate game of geopolitics in the region.
Competing Development Models: India's Economic Response Indeed, Bangladesh's
budding relationship with China brings in valuable economic dividends in terms of
infrastructure development, trade facilitation, and direct investment. Chinese financing of
transformative projects such as the Padma Bridge and Karnaphuli Tunnel has considerably
cemented China's economic engagement with Bangladesh. In response, India will further
increase its development aid and fast-track the long-impending projects of cross-border
railways, energy cooperation, and trade infrastructure. India may also expand its economic
corridor projects, including the India-Bangladesh-Nepal Connectivity Initiative, to
counterbalance Chinese investments. This competition could accelerate development in
Bangladesh, offering the country access to multiple development models while enhancing
its negotiating power with both nations.
Reduced Indian Political Influence on Bangladesh: Bangladesh's increasing alignment with
China could diminish India's political leverage in Dhaka, particularly if Chinese-backed
infrastructure and defence projects deepen strategic cooperation. Historically, India has
been the dominant player in Bangladesh's domestic and regional affairs, influencing its
trade, water-sharing agreements, and security policies. With China's expanding influence
through defence sales, port development, and diplomatic engagement, India risks losing its
traditional stronghold. The balancing role of Bangladesh can thus decrease the unilateral
influence of India, which may press New Delhi to take up a more conciliatory approach
toward sensitive issues, such as the Teesta water-sharing agreement, trade tariffs, and
border disputes. A robust relationship with China may position Bangladesh as an
independent actor in the political and economic affairs of South Asia, pushing India toward
more equitable and pragmatic negotiations.
Global Security Initiative (GSI): The GSI was proposed in 2022 with the purpose of changing
the world's security architecture through multilateral cooperation, conflict resolution, and
a policy of non-interference. This reflects China's ambition in shaping global security
frameworks beyond the traditional US-led alliances such as NATO and the Quad.
China's strategic objectives include:
Expand Geopolitical Influence: Establish its role as a global security provider in the Asia-
Pacific, South Asia, and beyond.
Deter Military Alliances: Balance US-led security partnerships, particularly in the Indo-
Pacific.25/05/2025, 11:42 China's global strategies and Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/chinas-global-strategies-and-bangladesh 3/12Protect Strategic Routes: Secure critical maritime routes, like that of the Bay of Bengal,
through regional security arrangements.
Impact on Bangladesh & South Asia: Bangladesh can become a regional security partner
through maritime security agreements and military technology cooperation.
China's experience in counterterrorism and surveillance technologies might further solidify
Bangladesh's domestic security apparatus. A strategic alignment with China would
decrease Bangladesh's reliance on India and its Western security partnerships, thereby
complicating its non-aligned foreign policy stance.
India, however, views any Bangladeshi alignment with China's security agenda as a direct
threat to its strategic dominance in South Asia. Greater Chinese military cooperation in the
Bay of Bengal may result in arms races or military build-ups in the region.
Global Civilisational Initiative (GCI): Launched in 2023, the GCI aims at building cross-
cultural understanding, people-to-people exchanges, and a narrative of mutual respect
among civilizations. This is China's soft power strategy to counter its alleged
authoritarianism and clean its image before the world community.
China's goals are:
Global Leadership in Cultural Diplomacy: Place China as a cultural leader in the promotion
of dialogue among civilisations.
Soft Power Expansion: Establish cultural ties through education, language programs,
cultural exchanges, and media partnerships.
Narrative Control: Recast global narratives about China's political system and development
model as culturally inclusive and globally beneficial.
Impact on Bangladesh: Bangladesh could benefit from scholarships, cultural exchanges,
and Confucius Institutes promoting Chinese culture and language. Cultural tourism
projects could expand Bangladesh's global appeal, enhancing economic opportunities.
Bangladesh must ensure cultural partnerships with China do not overshadow its historic
cultural ties with India or the West.
India, which prides itself on its ancient civilization and cultural diplomacy, may intensify its
efforts to maintain cultural influence in Bangladesh. The competition for cultural influence
could shape how South Asia is perceived globally, impacting educational, historical, and
media narratives.25/05/2025, 11:42 China's global strategies and Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/chinas-global-strategies-and-bangladesh 4/12Trilateral Geopolitical Impact: The simultaneous implementation of China's three global
strategies in Bangladesh could reshape the region's geopolitical dynamics in several key
ways:
Strategic Tug-of-War: India's concerns about losing strategic influence in Bangladesh could
intensify, prompting greater investment, diplomatic engagement, and defence
partnerships.
Economic Competition: Bangladesh could leverage the competition between China and
India to maximize development aid, trade agreements, and infrastructure investments.
Security Dilemmas: Greater Chinese security cooperation in Bangladesh may finally push
India toward consolidating regional alliances with the US, Japan, and Australia through the
Quad framework.
Cultural Rivalries. The competition in cultural diplomacy may redefine the historical
narratives and cultural exchanges in South Asia, affecting regional unity and soft power
influence.
Recommendations for Bangladesh: To navigate these complexities, Bangladesh should
adopt a balanced foreign policy and maintain strategic neutrality by engaging with both
China and India without jeopardising relations with either.
The country also needs to strengthen regional cooperation and promote multilateral
dialogues through platforms like SAARC and BIMSTEC to mitigate rivalry-driven conflicts.
Bangladesh also needs to expand ties with the US, EU, and ASEAN to reduce
overdependence on China and India.
Creating a unique Bangladeshi cultural narrative will also be necessary to further relations
with both China and India.
Improving domestic infrastructure, financial resilience, and security capabilities to deal
with external influences independently is another necessary task.
Strategic Window: The political situation in Bangladesh has created a narrow window of
opportunity for the caretaker government to take relations with China to the next level. The
timing is crucial, with India reportedly working to restore the political influence of former
authoritarian Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina-a move that risks destabilising Bangladesh's
fragile political balance. Strengthening relations with China might prove to be a stabilising
factor that would provide Bangladesh with a strong counterbalance against possible Indian
interference in its internal affairs. The continuous support that China has pledged toward25/05/2025, 11:42 China's global strategies and Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/chinas-global-strategies-and-bangladesh 5/12economic development, investment in infrastructure, and non-interference policies
corresponds with the strategic objectives of Bangladesh seeking political and economic
stability.
History has often seen India behave in a hegemonic manner toward Bangladesh's political
processes, leading to strains on diplomatic relations. Deepening relationships with China
can decrease dependency upon India and allow Bangladesh to leverage greater economic
and geopolitical authority. The BRI projects, trade partnerships, and infrastructure
development between China and Bangladesh have already transformed Bangladesh's
economy. Such expanded cooperation, on the back of reformist moves by a caretaker
government would afford Bangladesh faster progress in national development with a lesser
degree of vulnerability to political pressure from India.
Deepening engagement with China during a period of political transition can reorient the
power dynamics in South Asia. A strategically aligned Bangladesh-China partnership would
leave India with no option but to be more engaging in constructive diplomacy, especially on
the resolution of pending bilateral issues related to water-sharing agreements and cross-
border trade. As once said by Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Secretary of State, ""In crisis,
boldness is the safest option."" Bangladesh's proactive diplomacy with China could thus
pave the way for a more balanced, stable, and prosperous political future in South Asia.
Conclusion: Navigating a New Geopolitical Reality China's GDI, GSI, and GCI are rewriting
the global power dynamics, especially in South Asia, where Bangladesh occupies a crucial
geopolitical crossroads between two regional giants: China and India. These initiatives offer
Bangladesh transformative economic, security, and cultural partnerships but also come
with inherent complexities such as strategic dependency, regional rivalry, and cultural
contestation. Successfully navigating this landscape will require a nuanced and pragmatic
foreign policy that leverages Bangladesh's strategic location while balancing competing
interests.
As the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said, ""The pessimist sees
difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty.""
Bangladesh needs to be optimistic but calculated, looking at China's initiatives as an
opportunity, not a threat, for the advancement of its national development, regional
security, and cultural identity on the global stage. Such a balancing act might just yield the
much-needed infrastructure investments while strengthening its sovereignty in the face of
increasing Sino-Indian competition.
More importantly, echoing the phrase of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy that ""Let us
never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate,"" Bangladesh has to engage
both China and India assertively, extracting maximum economic and strategic value from25/05/2025, 11:42 China's global strategies and Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/chinas-global-strategies-and-bangladesh 6/12both relationships. A pragmatic foreign policy that keeps Bangladesh neutral yet
strategically aligned with major powers could position the country as a pivotal actor in
South Asia's evolving geopolitical landscape. Bangladesh might maintain a flexible foreign
policy-interest-driven, of course-in this era of shifting alliances around the world.
Bangladesh's capability for doing so many mark the road to sustained growth, stability, and
global recognition.
The Caretaker Government, under the farsighted leadership of Dr. Muhammad Yunus, is
better placed to rally wider mass support for deeper strategic rapport with China. The
approach also would not only counterbalance the political influence of India but would
serve as a very strong stabilising force amid Bangladesh's evolving political landscape.
Under existing geopolitical dynamics, this would be the best time to do so for Yunus,
vindicating again the age-old insight by Winston Churchill: ""To each, there comes a
moment… a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder to do a
very special thing. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or unqualified for
that which could have been their finest hour.""

Sino-Bangladesh relations: Mapping sectoral opportunities

""Friendship with All, Malice towards None"" was the message from the country's father of
the nation that is the guiding light of Bangladesh's foreign policy. We proudly recall the
times between 1972 and 1974 when his government had gained ground in diplomatic
journey of a war-ravaged Bangladesh.
The China-Bangladesh friendship is a long-standing one which has reached 43 years. China
attaches greater importance to development assistance to Bangladesh. For Bangladesh,
the economic tie with China is of greater significance as Beijing is now the leading trading
partner of Dhaka.
Bilateral trade between Bangladesh and China stood at $12.40 billion during the 2017-18
fiscal year. If the current trend of trading continues, economists predict, the bilateral trade
volume would reach up to $18 billion by 2021, the year Bangladesh will be celebrating its
50th anniversary of independence.
Bangladesh's 'Look East' policy is essentially designed to open up new avenues of
cooperation with China and the ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations). China
became the top source of foreign direct investment for Bangladesh with a volume of $1.03
billion in 2018, whereas the figure was only $119 million in 2017.
The two countries have made substantial progress on the diplomatic front in the past
decade. The historic visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2016 gave a new momentum as
Dhaka and Beijing signed 27 investment deals worth of nearly $40 billion, some of which
were in line with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Accordingly, the two tested friends are in
action in the areas of mega projects.BN
25/05/2025, 11:49 Sino-Bangladesh relations: Mapping sectoral opportunities | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/sino-bangladesh-relations-mapping-sectoral-opportunities-1565793456 1/6Bangladesh is one of the first countries in South Asia to support the construction of the Belt
and Road, and also an active supporter and participant in the construction of the BCIM-EC
(Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar economic corridor).
The growing success in relations between the two friendly countries has been reflected in a
series of landmark initiatives. They include construction of $3.7 billion Padma Bridge where
Beijing has provided more than $3.0 billion for the project as part of a wider plan to spend
$30 billion on Bangladeshi infrastructure projects, construction of Dhaka-Chittagong
Highway's 4-lane extension project, which is the largest road infrastructure project,
acquisition of 25 per cent shares of Dhaka Stock Exchange by Shenzhen-Shanghai stock
exchange consortium, Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, Payra 1,320-megawatt coal-fired
thermal power plant, Multi-lane Road Tunnel project under the Karnaphuli river,
Dasherkandi Sewage Treatment Plant Project funded by Export-Import Bank of China,
strategic partnership between Ant Finance and Bkash, and Mutual Trust Bank's
collaboration with UnionPay International to jointly launch debit and credit cards with
mobile payment services.
As Bangladesh is experiencing major transformation in numerous areas, it is imperative to
position itself strongly in the regional markets. In view of the momentum in the China-
Bangladesh relations, Dhaka needs to expedite formulation of strategic formulas to
strengthen the existing bilateral ties. A few of the areas, which could be looked into, are as
follows:
RMG EXPORT: Garment exports to China have remained stagnant for the last two years
primarily because of exports of basic garment items from Myanmar and Vietnam -- similar
to Bangladesh's exportable items -- to China for lower and middle-income groups. To
overcome this, the Bangladeshi exporters should look to diversify their products or come
up with alternative RMG export basket as China's demand for basic garment items, not
high-end products, is still relatively high.
TEXTILE MACHINERY MARKET: Bangladesh is the biggest machinery market for Chinese
textile and garment machine manufacturers. In this connection, Chinese companies can
invest in Bangladesh's light engineering sector, which has the potential to be the backward
linkage for textile machinery.
INDUSTRIAL RELOCATION: Bangladesh, blessed with her proximity to global trade and
financial hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore, has emerged as a
'Relocation Hotspot' for economies around the world and gained confidence of foreign
investors, especially from China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the USA and India.
Given the global trade war, Bangladesh is open to 'sunset industries' from China due to
their rising cost of production. Currently, fully operational nine (9) Export Processing Zones
(EPZ) and the government's plan to develop 100 Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have been
acting as 'growth enablers' for Bangladesh, branding it as a favourite destination for foreign
investors.
BRI AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONNECTIVITY: As the BRI enters into its 5th year, extended
synergy should be created between the businesses of the two countries to tap emerging
opportunities. Because, Bangladesh is an important connecting point for the land and
maritime Silk Roads, so it becomes a natural partner in the ""Belt and Road"" Initiative.
FINANCIAL COOPERATION: Bangladesh needs to innovate and expand new channels of
financial cooperation by making use of Chinese platforms such as the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) and Silk Road Funds involving Bangladesh's dynamic private sector.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE MARKET: Considering China's ""role model"" image in mainstreaming EVs
to compliment both environment and business, Bangladesh is eager to collaborate with
China in this area. Backward linkage of this industry -- battery production and automotive
light engineering -- is thriving in Bangladesh so the Chinese companies can take joint
venture with Bangladeshi battery manufacturers.25/05/2025, 11:49 Sino-Bangladesh relations: Mapping sectoral opportunities | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/sino-bangladesh-relations-mapping-sectoral-opportunities-1565793456 2/6AGRICULTURE: China is proud to serve the world with a range of high quality agricultural
products. Consensus can be made by both the sides to promote sustainable agri-business
best practices and climate-resilient farming models.
FLORICULTURE: Yunnan province has become China's largest research and development
base for new flower varieties developed under independent intellectual property rights.
Bangladesh has a burgeoning flower market where Yunnan model of collaborative
innovation including enterprises, academia and independent research institutes can be
followed.
HEALTHCARE: China is rapidly emerging as a desirable and affordable destination for
individuals seeking healthcare in a wide range of medical specialties, including cardiology,
neurology, and orthopaedics. In view of Bangladesh's lack in modern medical
infrastructure, strong synergy can be drawn in this area.
MEDICINE: China's Yunnan has played an important role in medicinal invention, cancer
prevention and therapeutic treatment in southwest China and southeast Asia. Mutual
cooperation between pharmaceutical industries of Bangladesh and Yunnan can be
expedited. In this connection, business-to-business meetings, and visit to factories
producing raw materials for medicine, will help create the path for building a strong
technological foundation for this industry in Bangladesh.
TOURISM: In recent years, Bangladesh has identified the tourism industry as a priority area
for development. Bangladeshi travel agencies provide hospitality and tour guiding training,
but the overall practical skills level is still short of the demand. Given China's experience in
tourism development, the two countries can establish a joint think-tank to improve tourism
sector research focussing on culture, training of tourism professionals and other areas.
There are of course more avenues of cooperation and mutual benefits between the two
countries. In the era of changing geopolitics, trade and investment cooperation is key to
adding value to the existing bilateral relations. So, Dhaka should apply fresh thoughts to
strengthen the Sino-Bangladesh relations.

Education Minister Dr Dipu Moni on Thursday termed China a ""steadfast ally"" of Bangladesh,
saying Beijing had continuously demonstrated a ""willingness to collaborate when required.""
""Our relationship, founded on trust, cooperation and mutual benefit, serves as a shining example
of international partnership,"" the minister said while launching a report on China's Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) in Bangladesh. The launch of the report by the Chinese embassy marked the 10th
anniversary of the initiative rolled out by President Xi Jinping in 2013.
""The joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative has opened a new door of development for
Bangladesh,"" Dipu Moni said.
Chinese Ambassador Yao Wen said Bangladesh was the first South Asian country to join the BRI
in 2016. Since then, Chinese investment in Bangladesh had grown from $241 million in 2016 to
$1.346 billion in 2022, he added. Meanwhile, two-way trade was $22.8 billion in 2022, up from
$15.3 billion, said the ambassador.
The ambassador said China had built 12 roads, 21 bridges, and 27 power and energy projects in
Bangladesh, adding that Chinese companies had created more than 550,000 jobs in Bangladesh.
There were more than 670 Chinese companies operating in Bangladesh, he said.
Meanwhile, Dipu Moni called the BRI a ""visionary global endeavour"" proposed by China, adding
that in the past seven years, “we have witnessed the contribution of the Belt and Road Initiative
has made to Bangladesh.”
""In the education section, BRAC University, a leading university of Bangladesh… its new
campus constructed by a Chinese company will help train the next generation of Bangladeshis to
serve the nation,"" she said.
""In power, China has helped Bangladesh achieve 100% electricity coverage, making Bangladesh
the first South Asian country to achieve this goal.
""In the ICT sector, China has helped Bangladesh establish a tier-4 data centre, which has brought
the dream of Smart Bangladesh one step closer.”.Publish : 21 Sep 2023, 10:20 PM

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/325995/dipu-moni-china-steadfast-ally-of-bangladesh 2/4The minister continued: ""China is also a major supplier of our road, bridge, railways and clean
energy… Clearly China and the Belt and Road Initiative have made great contributions for us to
realize our Vision 2041 and Sonar Bangla dreams.""
As the ambassador awarded licences to 16 Chinese companies whose South Asian headquarters
are in Bangladesh, Dipu Moni said it not only indicated the confidence of Chinese companies in
Bangladesh but also showed support for the Indo-Pacific outlook proposed by Bangladesh.
She referred to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and President of China Xi Jinping's recent meeting
in South Africa and said Sheikh Hasina had pointed out that the good relations between
Bangladesh and China were based on mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs.
""I believe, in the future, with the important consensus reached by our two countries’ leaders and
the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, Bangladesh and China can cooperate stronger in
policy, infrastructure, trade, finance and people-to-people connectivity.""
Transformative opportunity
According to the report, the BRI has emerged as a ""transformative opportunity for Bangladesh,
offering tremendous potential for buoyant economic activities, infrastructure development and
enhanced trade connectivity.""
The report divided BRI activities in Bangladesh into three areas: infrastructure development,
energy and power collaboration, and social and cultural exchange.
The Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel under
the Karnaphuli River in Chittagong, the Dhaka Elevated Expressway, the Dhaka-Ashulia
Elevated Expressway Project and the Dhaka Bypass Expressway Project are the major
infrastructure projects under the BRI, according to the report.
Major ICT-related projects include Info Sarkar Project 3 and IV Tier National Data Center.
Projects related to water, sanitation and the environment include the Dasherkandi Sewage
Treatment Plant Project and the Rajshahi Wasa Surface Water Treatment Plant Project.
Energy and power cooperation include the expansion and strengthening of the power system
network under DPDC and the Power Grid Network Strengthening Project Under the PGCB.
""Social and cultural exchange remains essential to China's BRI strategy, fostering mutual
understanding and cooperation among participating countries,"" the report said.

its debt-bearing capacity.
The majority of foreign debt is long-term in nature and is allocated for infrastructure and
capacity-building projects, it added.
Chinese development loans constitute only a small portion of Bangladesh's external debt
portfolio. Concerns about debt sustainability related to the BRI are often based on
misconceptions and overlook internal structural issues that need to be addressed, according to the
report.

China of course stands as a towering figure, with its economic prowess, technological
advancements, and strategic vision. With Bangladesh aspiring to transcend its developmental
challenges and carve out a prosperous future, having a friend in China will be extremely
important. 
China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has already laid the groundwork for enhanced connectivity
between the two nations. The China-Bangladesh Economic Corridor can be a game-changer by
bolstering infrastructure development. Robust transportation networks, upgraded ports, and
efficient logistics will not only facilitate seamless trade but also stimulate economic growth
across diverse sectors.
The transfer of technology and knowledge from China to Bangladesh can also serve as a catalyst
for industrialization and innovation. China is already helping with many of Bangladesh’s
megaprojects, and more collaborative ventures will only enhance productivity.
China and Bangladesh both also have aspirations for a greener future. Joint efforts in renewable
energy projects and eco-friendly initiatives can address shared challenges of climate change and
environmental degradation. China's experience in managing urbanization can also provide
valuable insights as Bangladesh grapples with the complexities of rapid urban development.
Bangladesh wants to become a developed nation in less than two decades, and it can accelerate its
journey towards economic prosperity and societal well-being by continuing to strengthen its ties
with a nation such as China. The time is ripe for both nations to take this partnership to the next
level.

Eurasian security and political group formed in 2001, being held in Islamabad and attended by of ficials from

""Flagship projects like the Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping...should be expanded focusing on
developing road, rail and digital infrastructure that enhances integration and cooperation across our
region,"" Sharif said in his speech as the chair of the meeting.
The BRI is a $1 trillion plan for global infrastructure and energy networks that China launched a decade
ago to connect Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime routes. Beijing's rivals see the BRI
as a tool for China to spread its geopolitical and economic influence.
Western countries, under the G7 platform, last year announced a $600 billion plans to launch a rival
connectivity infrastructure development plan. BRI has also been criticised for increasing unsustainable debt
in developing countries.
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a part of the BRI and has seen Beijing pump in billions of
dollars into the South Asian country for road networks, a strategic port and an airport.25/05/2025, 11:22 Pakistan PM Sharif calls for China's BRI expansion

The SCO meeting is the highest-profile event hosted by the troubled South Asian nation in years. Seven
prime ministers are attending, including Chinese Premier Li Qiang.
Sharif also said stability in neighbouring Afghanistan, which lies between South and Central Asia, was
essential to fully realising trade opportunities for the SCO member states.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/347578/bangladesh-not-ready-for-the-new-game-of 1/4Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, has said Bangladesh is
not ready to deal with the ""game of engagement"" in the future ""multiverse, multifocal and multi-
layered"" world.
Speaking at the unveiling of a book titled ""The Changing Nature of Geopolitics and the Futures
of Bangladesh,” he said Bangladesh has no enemy so far, but the future world will be ""fluid
multipolar,"" which will be difficult to deal with.
Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and former foreign
minister Dr AK Abdul Momen was present as the chief guest.
Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, also executive director of the Centre for Alternatives, edited the book.
He said the future will be a world which is ""multiverse, multifocal and multi-layered. Any
mathematical equation also will be very difficult.” 
""Are we ready for it? Is the curriculum allowing us to do that? That is the question. And I
definitely will say we are not ready for that,"" he said. 
""But the good part is that there are technologies which can help us. It is important to connect the
global world technologically. We should be connected with different countries of the world. 
""It is possible now, unless we do that, if we remain, you know, as we remained in the 19th or 20th
century, we cannot take the benefit of this particular century,"" he said.
He, however, said that Bangladesh is one country in the world which has no enemy, so far.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/347578/bangladesh-not-ready-for-the-new-game-of 2/4""And so it is a development without enmity. We are members of Saarc, Bimstec, BBIN, BCIM,
Indo-Pacific Alliance, BRI…name anything we are ready to see."" 
For that, he, however, credited the civilizational roots of Bangalis welcoming foreigners.
""This is the civilizational context of being a Bangali. Even now, we welcome outsiders like
anything. Some outsiders overstay. There is a problem. The British overstayed for 200 years,"" he
quipped, referring to the British rule in the subcontinent.
Former foreign minister Dr Momen while discussing the book said when “we are talking of trade
and other policies, one can look into the consumer or effective demand, domestic effective
demand and how to design policy packages so that the domestic effective demand continues to
grow, to give the economy a byproduct.”
He gave an example of the US and said the major income of the US comes from the domestic
market, the consumer market.
""The contribution of the US government to GDP is around 21% and private sector contribution is
around 70%, totalling 91%. So, 91% of GDP contribution, we say, comes from the consumer
market. So it is an economy that runs with its own people.”
Even in India, he said, 70% of GDP comes from the private sector and 14% from government
expenditure. “And in Bangladesh, the government sector is larger–it is 26% as per the estimates
here.”
Former state minister for foreign affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury and former principal officer of
the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen (Retd) Mahfuzur Rahman was also present at the event,
jointly organized by the Diplomats World magazine, FES Bangladesh and the Centre for
Alternatives.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/financial-markets/331378/aiddata-bangladesh-to-remain-a-key-battleground 1/5US-based research lab AidData has analyzed Chinese investment in Bangladesh under the Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI) and said that the country will likely remain “a key battleground for
great power competition” in the coming years given its unique locational position and recent
geopolitical trends.
AidData, housed at William & Mary's Global Research Institute in Virginia, generates evidence
for policymakers and practitioners to improve how sustainable development investments are
targeted, monitored, and evaluated.
The report on the BRI comes as Beijing is celebrating the 10th anniversary of President Xi
Jinping’s signature initiative. Bangladesh was the first South Asian country to join the BRI in
2016.
AidData found that out of the total Chinese development finance portfolio of $20.79 billion
committed between 2000 and 2021 in Bangladesh, 19% was ODA (grants and highly
concessional loans) and 81% was OOF (other official sector loans).
Compared to only $175 million per year during the BNP era (2002-06), Chinese development
financing doubled to $381 million in Bangladesh during Sheikh Hasina’s first term (2009-14).
Since then, it has risen seven-fold to $2.2 billion (2014-2018) and $2.3 billion (2019-till date).
However, the research lab found that Bangladesh does not have any hidden debt exposure to
China, indicating that the likelihood of unaccounted-for (or implicit) liabilities on the government
of Bangladesh to Chinese official sector lenders is low.
But it was noted that the majority of the projects, 59%, are facing ESG - Environmental, Social,
or Governance – risks, a claim that Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen disagrees with.
Replying to a Dhaka Tribune question, the Ambassador recently at an event said he was aware of
the report and that he found a ""generally good assessment” of the BRI.
On the specific ESG risks, he said: “I can ensure all the projects China conducts with Bangladesh
on the BRI have had very strict environmental assessments. It was based on these feasibility
studies. All the projects are based on scientific and very strict environmental assessments. So I'm
quite sure so far all the projects are safe in terms of environmental factors.”

https://www.dhakatribune.com/financial-markets/331378/aiddata-bangladesh-to-remain-a-key-battleground 2/5Great power  competition
Given its unique locational position and recent geopolitical trends—including the rise of India
and growing Sino-US tensions in the South China Sea—Bangladesh will likely remain a key
battleground for great power competition in the coming years, said AidData.
From Dhaka’s vantage point, growing competition between China and the US in the Indo-Pacific
region only offers more opportunities for improving economic growth.
Its economy still needs diversification, such as through new competitive industries adjacent to its
dominant textile industry.
This will require investment, skills transfer, and further integration of existing industries into
global supply chains.
A deepening trade relationship with China, potentially through the planned rail link via Myanmar,
could increase economic prosperity through job creation, it said.
From the US perspective, its robust trade ties with Bangladesh and strong alliance with India
(Bangladesh’s most influential regional partner) may provide opportunities to make inroads.
“Yet recent events—including vote rigging, voter intimidation, the use of violence, and the
targeting of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus through the judicial system—have put
Washington in a tough position,” it said.
“As a defender of liberal democracies around the world, Washington may feel compelled to
condemn actions that would push Bangladesh further down the path of authoritarianism. On the
other hand, it cannot ignore the realpolitik consideration that China’s influence is expanding in
South and Southeast Asia.”
Early BRI period
During the early BRI period, China made modest media sentiment gains in Bangladesh at the
expense of the US.
It also dramatically increased the provision of aid and credit to Bangladesh during the late BRI

Whereas average annual ODA and OOF commitments from China to Bangladesh were only $994
million between 2014 and 2017, this figure soared to $3.4 billion between 2018 and 2021.

after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won her second consecutive electoral victory in 2018. It also
coincided with a period of rising authoritarianism,” AidData summarised.
China’ s late BRI era foray into Bangladesh
In May 2021, Chinese Ambassador Li Jiming issued a stern warning to Bangladesh’s elites.
In response to reports that Dhaka might join the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad)—an
informal coalition between the US, Japan, Australia, and India—he said that such a move would
inflict “substantial damage” on Sino-Bangla relations.
“This uncharacteristically blunt remark provoked strong pushback from Bangladesh’s Foreign
Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen.”
“We are an independent and sovereign state. We decide our foreign policy,” he said.
He also clarified that Dhaka was neither approached by the members of the Quad nor was its
participation in the Quad a possibility under active consideration.
This diplomatic spat highlights Bangladesh’s desire to delicately balance relations with the US
and its closest regional partner (India) while bolstering its “strategic partnership” with China.
Bangladesh is located in the strategically vital Indo-Pacific region, serving as a gateway between
South Asia and Southeast Asia.
For China, it is an entry point to the Bay of Bengal, and its proximity to Myanmar increases its
strategic value to the US and its Quad allies.
Public debt exposur e, ESG risks
At $17.1 billion, Bangladesh’s public debt exposure to China is 4.1% of GDP, which is 6.9
percentage points below the global average in China’s portfolio.
“Bangladesh does not have any hidden debt exposure to China, showing the likelihood of
unaccounted for (or implicit) liabilities on the government of Bangladesh to Chinese official
sector lenders is low,” AidData said.
“Unlike countries like Pakistan and Argentina, Bangladesh has yet to receive any rescue loans
from China, indicating proactive debt management. This is likely due to the fact that Bangladesh

While only two projects have been suspended or cancelled, the majority (59%) are facing ESG
risks.
This includes the energy sector, where several high-profile coal-fired power plants were financed.
Only one-quarter of the portfolio is protected by strong ESG contract safeguards, indicating
higher risks of implementation challenges in the future, according to the report.
At 55% and 31% of the entire portfolio respectively, the Energy and Transport and Storage
sectors received the vast majority of Chinese development finance.
AidData said the proportion of this portfolio facing significant ESG risks has increased
dramatically, from $1 billion in 2015 to over $12 billion by 2021.
Since joining the BRI, according to the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka, Chinese investment in
Bangladesh has grown to $1.346 billion in 2022 from $241 million in 2016.  
Two-way trade was $22.8 billion in 2022, up from $15.3 billion in 2016. China has built 12
roads, 21 bridges, and 27 power and energy projects in Bangladesh, and 670 Chinese companies
have created more than 550,000 jobs.

China values its relations with Bangladesh and stands ready to work with
Bangladesh to promote bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various areas. 
It also looks to further advance comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership
between the two countries, said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said this
during a briefing in Beijing today, a day after the interim government led by Prof
Muhammad Yunus took oath.
""China has noted that Bangladesh has formed an interim government and
welcomes it. China strictly follows the principle of non-interference in other
countries' internal affairs,"" the spokesperson said.
He said China respects Bangladesh's independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and the development path independently chosen by the Bangladeshi
people.
""We stand firmly by our policy of good neighbourliness and friendship with all
people of Bangladesh. The friendship between China and Bangladesh runs long
and deep.""",0.030769231,0.307051282,,Neutral

China, the world's largest solar power producer, wants to invest in the production
of solar panels in Bangladesh, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Prof
Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser to the interim government, on Wednesday. 
Photo: CA Office
Meeting on the sideline of the UN General Assembly in New York, he said China
would attach importance to Prof Yunus's call to Chinese solar panel
manufacturers to set up factories in Bangladesh.
The chief adviser had urged this when the Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh
paid a courtesy call on him last month.
Yunus told Wang Yi that Chinese solar companies could invest in a bigger way in
Bangladesh, which enjoys preferable market access to many developed nations.
Currently, China has a total of 609,921 megawatts of installed
solar power plants, which is the highest across the globe
Currently, China has a total of 6,09,921 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power
plants, which is the highest across the globe, according to data of International
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
In contrast, Bangladesh installed 603MW solar plants so far, according to data of
Bangladesh Power Development Board.
Bangladesh entered its renewable energy era in 2017 with the launch of a 3MW
solar power plant in Jamalpur's Sharishabari. But since then, the progress in
increasing renewable energy installations has been very slow.
Though the country has plans to meet around 30 percent of its power demand
from clean energy by 2030 and 40 percent by 2040, the capacity is still at around 3
percent or 893MW, including energy generated from wind and hydroelectric
power plants.
In Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan 2022-2041, submitted in the Conference of
Parties (COP26), the renewable energy capacity target for 2030 had been set at
6,000MW-16,000MW.
This means, the country will have to generate about 5,100MW of electricity from
renewable sources in the next six years to attain even the lowest committed
amount.
Currently, the country has a capacity to produce around 27,000 MW of electricity
mostly from fossil fuel-based plants, a key contributor of global warming.
GREATER T RADE T IES
Wang Yi said Beijing would also encourage greater cooperation and partnership
between businesses of the two nations to deepen trade and economic ties with
Dhaka.
He said Bangladesh would benefit from a Chinese decision to provide zero tariff
access to all goods from the least developed countries.
He said the Red Cross Society of China has sent a team of doctors to treat students
and people who were grievously injured during the July-August mass uprising.
Wang Yi also said China would welcome more students from Bangladesh.
Wang Yi described Prof Yunus as ""an old friend of the Chinese people"" and
congratulated him for assuming leadership of the interim government.
""We have full confidence in you, that you will live up to the expectations of the
people,"" he said, adding that Yunus would also unite the country.
Prof Yunus thanked China and lauded Chinese efforts to lift hundreds of millions
of people out of poverty.
The chief adviser stressed on closer relations with China and opening ""a new
chapter"" in the ties between the two nations.
He also urged other Chinese product manufacturers to relocate their factories to
Bangladesh and engage in technological collaborations. ""We will love to
collaborate with Chinese companies. We have a lot of scope to work together,"" he
said.
China Committed to Bilateral Relations
Meanwhile, Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen said irrespective of the
changes that have taken place inside Bangladesh, China's commitment to
developing bilateral relations remains unchanged, reports news agency UNB.
China sincerely hopes that under the interim government, Bangladesh will carry
out state reform, maintain political stability, advance economic development and
improve people's livelihoods, he said.
To support Bangladesh's development, China decided to grant zero-tariff
treatment on 100 percent of taxable items from Bangladesh, he told an event at a
hotel in Dhaka on Wednesday marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of
China.
This means China will substantially increase import of cereals, sugar, edible oil,
rubber and rubber products, wood products, jute and jute products, paper and
paper products, wool and cotton from Bangladesh from December 1, 2024, said
Yao Wen.
China will also import Bangladeshi mangoes, he added.
To combat floods, China is about to provide rescue facilities and equipment to
Bangladesh, he said.
Yao Wen said since the interim government came to office, Chinese enterprises
have invested more than $85 million in Bangladesh.
He said China would organise programmes focusing political exchange, economic
and trade cooperation, culture, education, tourism, sports, public health, youth,
women, media and academic interactions for improving people-to-people ties.
""I expect the young people to devote themselves to China-Bangladesh
cooperation, passing the torch of friendship from generation to generation,"" he
said.
Commerce and Finance Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed joined the event as chief
guest while Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin was also present.

Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain has said relations between Bangladesh and China
have set “an example of amicable coexistence and cooperative success,” calling for a “more
comprehensive approach” with the political changes in Dhaka. 
“Both countries, from the very beginning, supported each other on matters of core interests and
worked together on the path to realizing their respective development. Hence, diplomatic ties
between Bangladesh and China have set an example of amicable coexistence and cooperative
success,” the adviser said on Monday while speaking at a seminar on ""Bangladesh-China
Relations: A Future Outlook"" at InterContinental Dhaka.
“Now, as Bangladesh has witnessed the most significant political change in its national history,
therefore, the future of Bangladesh-China relations in a post-revolution setting requires a more
comprehensive approach,” he added.
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen and experts from both sides spoke at the seminar
organized by the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) in
collaboration with the Centre for China Studies, DU.
The foreign adviser said it is likely that the post-revolution trajectory of Bangladesh and its future
relations with China might be influenced by various factors, including Bangladesh's political
stability as well as the changing dynamics of regional and global politics.
“Yet, although the future of bilateral ties between Bangladesh and China can be shaped by several
factors, the core elements of cooperation such as aspects of trade and investment, infrastructure
development, and technology sharing need to endure, since these aspects are propelled by mutual
interests in economic advancement and regional stability,” Touhid said.
“In the coming days, along with focusing on the core elements, both countries can also expedite
meaningful collaboration on several other emerging areas such as green energy, tourism, satellite
technology and climate change.Publish : 14 Oct 2024, 02:59 PM

35th anniversary of Bangladesh-China diplomatic ties _ The Daily Star (3).pdf,"35th anniversary of Bangladesh-China
diplomatic ties
Wed Oct 20, 2010 12:00 AM
Last update on: Wed Oct 20, 2010 12:00 AM
Bangladesh-China friendship conference centre, Dhaka.
The 35th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Bangladesh and China was
observed on October 4, this year. In 1975 on this date, China opened its
diplomatic mission in Bangladesh
Relationship with China has become one of the priorities of successive
Bangladesh governments. The heads of government of Bangladesh, irrespective
of their political affiliations, invariably visited China and met with top Chinese
leaders to strengthen relations in every possible sector.
Both nations seek a modern partnership based on common interests in meeting
the major challenges of the 21st century.
Bangladesh's relation with China has taken a multi-faceted direction since its
inception. Relations with China are not confined only to state-to-state basis.
China is interested in developing party-to-party relations and, during early March
of this year, a Communist Party delegation's short trip to Dhaka to meet officials
of mainstream political parties demonstrated this fact.
China has assisted Bangladesh in infrastructure, power -- including hydro-power -
- coal mining, setting up industrial plants, telecommunications, flood control,
disaster prevention, river training, irrigation and water resources utilisation.
The visit by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in March this year, and
that of the China's Vice President Xi Jinping to Dhaka in June (he has been
anointed as the likely successor to President Hu Jintao as party chief in 2012) are
evidence of the strength of the economic and political connections between
Bangladesh and China. It has set the scene for greater understanding between the
two countries.
A large portion of our country's infrastructural development, including roads and
bridges, power plants, mining and industrial establishments were built with
Chinese assistance and technology.
China built six bridges in the country. The 4.8 kilometer long Mukhterpur Bridge
over the river Dhaleswari, built by China Road and Bridge Corporation, was
inaugurated on February 18, 2008.
All the bridges have contributed to the accelerated socio-economic growth of the
country, besides facilitating the movement of people and goods within the length
and breadth of the country.
During the visit of the Bangladesh prime minister in March 17-21, China signed
Letters of Exchange on construction of the seventh Bangladesh-China Friendship
Bridge at Kajirtek of Madaripur. China agreed to intensify efforts for the early
start of the second Meghna Bridge and the construction of Bangladesh-China
Friendship Exhibition Centre.
By 2009 China's direct investment in Bangladesh had reached $88 million -- much
higher than the previous two years -- and in 2010, there are about 186 Chinese
enterprises with a registered capital of $320 million in Bangladesh.
Over the past few years, China has replaced India as Bangladesh's biggest trading
partner with bilateral trade between the two nations, as of 2009, standing at $4.58
billion -- though heavily skewed in favour of Beijing with Bangladesh imports
being $4.4 billion.
This year, China offered duty-free access to some 5,000 Bangladeshi products as a
""goodwill gesture"" in a significant development in economic ties between the two
countries. The products include medicinal materials, plastic appliances, leather,
timber, textile, readymade garments and poultry products.
China has provided 40 million Yuan as grant under an economic cooperation
agreement. According to China, although the sum of money provided to
Bangladesh is not the largest among all development partners, they put emphasis
on the actual result of the assistance and whether such assistance can bring
about concrete good to Bangladesh people.
Furthermore, two agreements were concluded -- one for Shahjalal Fertiliser
Factory and another for the establishment of 2.5 3G telecommunication project.
China has agreed to extend its cooperation in agriculture under the MoU of 2005
in areas of hybrid rice, cultivation technology, rice seed technology, agricultural
machinery technology, exchange of germ plasma resources of crops, farm
products processing and technical personnel training. Furthermore, both sides
will explore specific ways and means of expanding agricultural cooperation.
China agreed to increase the number of scholarships to Bangladeshi students
from 80 to 150 within the next three years.
China's help is necessary in Bangladesh's efforts to mitigate the severe effects of
climate change in the shape of floods and other natural calamities. In river
training and dredging China has an enormous reservoir of know-how, which it
can share with Bangladesh.
Future Cooperation with China may be explored in the following areas:
-Water resource management;
-Renewable use energy -- solar, wind power and biomass;
-Interconnectivity through multi-modal transport between Bangladesh and
China;
-Assistance to help build Bangladesh's deep sea port near Cox's Bazar;
-Chinese direct investment in Bangladesh and establishment of an exclusive EPZ
for China;
-Shifting of low-end industries to Bangladesh from China, (such garments and
leather);
-Maritime security.
A study by an international group, the Strategic Foresight Group, under the
heading ""The Himalayan Challenge -- Water Security in Emerging in Asia,""
released on June 28, says that over 200 dams are to be built by China and India on
the Himalayan rivers Yangtze, Brahmaputra and the Ganges to meet their water
needs.
The study states that building such dams will alter the flow of Bangladesh rivers
in the dry season. A decrease in water supply by up to 22% in the next two
decades, rise in sea level, and increase in population may threaten Bangladesh
with the risks of food insecurity, outbreak of water-borne diseases and loss of bio-
diversity.
In our part of the region, a Himalayan River Commission may be set up with
China, Nepal, India and Bangladesh to work together to facilitate basin-wide
development to avoid conflicts among states.
The two countries share many of the challenges that will shape the region in the
years ahead. Likewise there are avenues for collaboration to take advantage of
opportunities that will unfold with the 21st century. It is clear that both nations
can and should do more together.
In my view, Bangladesh's relationship with China ought to be a truly modern
partnership, one that is practical, open and engaged on the global challenges that
face both nations. I am confident that this is an aspiration that people of both
countries share.

China wants to address the challenges of the ʻreciprocal tariffʼ imposed by the Trump
administration in collaboration with other countries, including Bangladesh and the
European Union, said Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen on Sunday.
Terming the US tariff move ʻa crazyʼ decision, which jeopardises the international trading
order, he said China is looking forward to Bangladesh and others, including the European
Union, working together to stop the turmoil and to bring the matter to the right track, to
ʻfind the right way outʼ.
“So, let's work together,” the ambassador said while addressing a seminar on ʻReassessing
Sino-Bangla relations: Chief Adviserʼs landmark visitʼ organised by the China-South Asia
Centre for Socio Cultural Studies (CSCSS) of the South Asian Institue of Policy and
Governance (SIPG), North South University in the city.
National Security Adviser, and High Representative to the Chief Adviser Khalilur Rahman
was the chief guest in the seminar, moderated by Tawfiq M Haque, director of the SIPG.
Referring to the Bangladesh governmentʼs invitation to the Chinese companies for involving
in the Teesta River water management project, he said his country has been involved in
many game-changing projects in Bangladesh, and now China is ready for the Teesta Project
also.
“The relations between Bangladesh and China are not focused on any particular party or
government but aim to serve the interests of the people”, the Chinese envoy spelt out.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/global/china-to-collaborate-with-bd-eu-others-to-counter-trump-tariff 1/5About the US tariff, he said it has hugely disrupted the current multilateral Free Trade
Agreement and is against international law.
But he made it clear China hits back against the US move and imposed increased tariffs
against US exports in a similar fashion.
“We'll fight back. We're fighting for free trade. We're fighting for the balance and justice of
the world. We're maintaining this current international trade agreement.”
However, he mentioned that China is also for negotiation.
“China is ready if the US wants to talk with us. China will not reject any talk. But talks are
possible if they are based on mutual trust. China will not talk to someone. So China will
wait and see what the next move taken over by the US.""
But until this China continues to fight, not only for themselves but for the world, he said,
adding that “We are taking this responsibility”.
Mr Wen emphasised the importance of economic cooperation between Bangladesh and
China with a focus on deeper integration and mutual support and described the chief
adviserʼs visit to China as a milestone, highlighting the political message of mutual support
between the two countries.
“The visit is seen as defining the future direction of cooperation, with increased mutual
trust and discussions on terror issues. The one China principle is reiterated, opposing
independence for Taiwan, and Bangladesh's expected support for China's stance on the
issue,” he added.
He noted that the upcoming visit of a delegation from China will focus on educational and
healthcare cooperation.
“Next week, the government of Yunnan will visit Bangladesh, and this time they'll do two
very important missions for the visit. One is enhanced educational cooperation. The other
is on healthcare. So you must be aware that we already opened four hospitals in the
province for the treatment of the patients from Bangladesh. The first batch of patients only
went there. So, they are encouraged by the treatment provided by these four hospitals. So
it is just our first step,” Mr Wen said.
The Chinese delegationʼs visit also aims to open more Chinese hospitals in Bangladesh and
enhance vocational educational training through collaboration with North South
University, he said, adding that Chinese companies plan to establish a regional training
centre in Bangladesh to train local labourers for projects in the Middle East and Europe.

China yet to turn into big export
destination
Thu Jul 4, 2024 12:00 AM
Last update on: Thu Jul 4, 2024 12:47 PM
The country offered generous trade benefits to Bangladesh
China could not become a potential export destination for Bangladesh despite
offering generous preferential trade benefits for the past decade or so.
On the other hand, two Asian countries, India and Japan, have proved to be very
good export destinations for Bangladesh over the years.
Bangladesh's exports to Japan reached $1.69 billion in the July-May period of the
immediate past fiscal year and stood at $1.90 billion in fiscal year 2022-23,
according to data from the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).
The export of local merchandise to India reached $1.67 billion in the July-May
period of the immediate past fiscal year and $2.12 billion in fiscal year 2022-23.
The shipment of goods from Bangladesh to China reached $761.02 million in the
July-May period of the immediate past fiscal year and $677.35 million in fiscal
year 2022-23.
The exports to China did not grow that much in spite of the presence of a zero-
duty benefit for 98 percent of Bangladeshi products.
But China has eventually turned into the largest import destination for
Bangladesh, with annual imports reaching over $23 billion, according to data
from the commerce ministry.
In 2015, China offered various least developed countries (LDCs) extensions on the
trade benefits for up to 97 percent of their goods and later the percentage was
elevated to up to 98 percent for Bangladesh.
The share of China in Bangladesh's imports has risen from 10.3 percent in FY02 to
26.4 percent in FY22, according to a study by Mohammad Abdur Razzaque,
chairman of the Research and Policy Integration for Development (RAPID), made
public last month.
Imports from China rose from less than $1 billion to more than $23.5 billion in
FY23. Imports from China are important for Bangladesh's export growth and
domestic industries as well for consumers.
A significant portion of imports from China come through bonded warehouses
duty free as those are used in the export industry.
One of the main reasons for exports not increasing to China is a lack of product
diversification.
Because China itself is the largest apparel and textile supplier worldwide
occupying more nearly 32 percent of the global share.
China imports $10 billion worth of garment items in a year from all over the
world while Bangladesh's main export item is garments which typically
contributes more than 84 percent to national exports in a year, according to the
paper.
China and Bangladesh are holding dialogues for signing a free trade agreement
(FTA) to increase trade and investment, with the first round of negotiations likely
to begin during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to China next week.
Bangladesh currently accounts for just 0.04 percent of China's imports. A share of
1 percent would translate to export earnings of $26 billion for Bangladesh,
Razzaque said in his study.
In case of garments, Bangladesh's market share in China is just 4 percent. In
contrast, Vietnam has an 18 percent share, the study also said.
The study also found that China's investment in Bangladesh's export-oriented
sectors would be very helpful.
Due to the heightening of geopolitical tensions, Bangladesh could be an ideal
destination for investment in export-oriented manufacturing production, it said.
An FTA with China will be extremely beneficial, considering the medium to long-
term export interests of Bangladesh. In such an FTA, due attention should be
given to trade in services and technology transfer, it added.
However, Bangladesh needs to improve on its exports to China. An FTA with
China with provisions for complementary investment inflows into Bangladesh's
export sector will be very much impactful, said the study.
Meanwhile, China should extend its duty-free market access benefits for
Bangladesh. In an FTA, the less-than-full reciprocity principle should be followed
in favour of Bangladesh, it said.
Once the FTA is signed, the use of the duty-free benefit can be thoroughly
utilised, Al Mamun Mridha, secretary general of the Bangladesh China Chamber
of Commerce and Industry, told The Daily Star yesterday.
The trade gap between Bangladesh and China is big because the local exporters,
especially the garment exporters, import the raw materials from China to re-
export to other countries, Mridha also said.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's China visit has laid the foundation for a forward-
looking and expansive relationship and Dhaka now needs to play its due role to
make the most of it, according to international relations analysts.

Following their meeting on July 10, Hasina and Chinese President Xi Jinping
announced the elevation of the bilateral relationship to ""Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership of Cooperation"" (CSPC) from the ""Strategic Partnership of
Cooperation"" established in 2016.
The elevation of the bilateral relationship to CSPC means the cooperation will
deepen in all the sectors possible keeping in mind Bangladesh's vision for 2041,
said M Humayun Kabir, a former diplomat.
Xi and Hasina agreed to ""foster greater synergy between development strategies
of the two countries"", according to the joint statement issued on the conclusion of
Hasina's three-day tour.
The Asian giant has huge capabilities in funding, technology, clean energy,
healthcare, infrastructure and so on, according to Kabir.
""The question is if Bangladesh will be able to take advantage of the new
relationship with China,"" he said.
The two sides agreed to deepen cooperation in trade, investment and finance, and
to conclude the joint feasibility study on a China-Bangladesh free trade
agreement.
""This will significantly boost trade between the two countries,"" said Kabir, also
the president of Bangladesh Enterprise Institute, a non-profit, non-political
research centre.
China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner by a wide margin, with bilateral
trade amounting to upwards of $25 billion. However, Bangladesh's exports
account for less than 3 percent of the sum.
""China has completed the entry procedures for Bangladesh's fresh mango exports
to China, and welcomes Bangladesh to expand exports of jute, leather, aquatic
products and other high-quality special products to China. The two sides agreed
to further strengthen communication on the export of high-quality Bangladeshi
agricultural products to China,"" the joint statement said.
Ahead of the three-day visit, there was expectation that Beijing would provide a
$5 billion loan in yuan for trade facilitation to help Bangladesh cope with the
strain on currency reserves, and billions more for projects.
At a press briefing after Hasina's meeting with Li Qiang on Wednesday, Foreign
Minister Hasan Mahmud said China has agreed to provide 1 billion yuan (about
$137 million) in assistance. However, the joint statement does not mention this
assistance extended to Bangladesh.
China has now become more cautious in giving out loans after it was blamed for
the economic crisis in some countries such as Sri Lanka, said Kabir, who served
as Bangladesh's ambassador to Nepal and the US and the high commissioner to
Australia.
In case of Bangladesh too, China is exercising the same caution.
For instance, China has decided to form a joint technical committee for assessing
the projects proposed by Bangladesh, Kabir said.
""I would say that this visit is meant to build a relationship that is futuristic and
expansive,"" he added.
China committed to provide about $20 billion during Xi's visit to Dhaka in 2016
for a host of mega projects. Some of the projects are yet to be implemented. So
Bangladesh did not get the full amount pledged.
""So, China wants better scrutiny this time -- Beijing would like to look at the nitty-
gritty of the projects this time,"" said Mahbub Uz Zaman, former ambassador to
China.
Xi spoke about building party-to-party relationship between the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and the ruling Awami League in Bangladesh. He said ""good
governance requires good party"".
Asked what this means, Imtiaz Ahmed, executive director of the Centre for
Alternatives, said: ""This is Chinese approach of building relationship, which they
do everywhere. Through this, they find it easier to implement their policies.""
The Awami League can learn discipline and governance of the party from the
CPC, said Ahmed, also a professor of international relations at the University of
Dhaka.
Xi also assured Hasina of support for repatriating the more than a million
Rohingya. However, analysts say how far it will work will depend on the situation
in Myanmar, which is now going through a civil war.
Repatriation has not been possible in the last seven years despite several efforts
including under a tripartite mechanism under Chinese leadership.
On this, Kabir said: ""Chinese assurance is great and is required for the solution,
but we will have to wait to see what happens in Myanmar, particularly in the
Rakhine State in the days to come.""

China ready to im prove strategic

Xi Jinping tells President Hamid
Chinese President Xi Jinping has said he stands ready to work with Bangladesh to
better align the two countries' strategies and jointly promote the construction of
the Belt and Road to take the China-Bangladesh strategic partnership of
cooperation to new heights, reports Xinhua.
He made the remarks in an exchange of congratulatory messages with his
Bangladesh counterpart Mohammad Abdul Hamid as the two countries
celebrated the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties yesterday.
Xi said the China-Bangladesh friendship has a long history and remains ever new
over time.
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 45 years ago, the two countries have
always respected each other and treated each other as equals, enhanced political
mutual trust and deepened mutually beneficial cooperation that brings tangible
benefits to the two peoples, he noted.
Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, China and Bangladesh have stuck
together through thick and thin, helped each other and fought against the
pandemic side by side, writing a new chapter of bilateral friendship, the Chinese
president added.
This year, China has also offered zero-tariff treatment to 97 percent of
Bangladesh's exports by adding 5,161 more items to the existing list of 3,095 duty-
free products.
With some $26 billion Chinese investments and $38 billion funding
commitments, Bangladesh is one of the largest recipients of China's massive
infrastructure project.
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), President Xi's top priority initiative, aims firm
up China's global influence through rail, maritime and road links from Asia to
Europe and Africa in a revival of ancient Silk Road trading routes.
Bangladesh has joined BRI, saying it is ready to be part of any initiative that is
aimed at promoting economy, connectivity, peace and sustainability.
India, which has yet to join it, and its ally US, however, are critical of the
initiative. They said Chinese financing of projects lead to debt-trap of the
recipients. Dhaka maintains that it is careful and makes sure that the country
does not fall into debt trap.
For his part, President Hamid in the message said the Bangladesh-China
relationship is developing rapidly and has covered cooperation in key areas, to
which Bangladesh attaches great importance.
He expressed his deep appreciation for China's continuous support for
Bangladesh in its socio-economic development progress, adding that he believes
the close and friendly relationship between the two countries will continue to
deepen in the future.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also exchanged congratulatory messages with his
Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina.
In his message, Li said China is willing to deepen practical cooperation with
Bangladesh in various fields and promote the steady and sustainable
development of the China-Bangladesh strategic partnership of cooperation to
better benefit the two countries and their people.
For her part, Hasina said the strategic partnership of cooperation between
Bangladesh and China has been developed from the two countries' time-tested
friendship and cooperation.
The strengthened Bangladesh-China cooperation has unleashed enormous
potential in maintaining peace, security and stability in the region and even
around the world, she said.",0.107756133,0.48200457,,Positive

Xi Jinping's visit: Implications for
Bangladesh-China relations
Fri Oct 14, 2016 12:00 AM
Last update on: Fri Oct 14, 2016 01:39 PM
Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Bangladesh is likely to be a landmark one
owing to a number of factors. After three decades, a Chinese President is visiting
Bangladesh, signifying growing importance of the country in South Asia's
economics and geo-politics. A number of high profile investments and other
business deals worth billions are expected to be signed during Mr. Xi's trip.

However, the implications of the visit go beyond economics. Dhaka maintains
very strong military ties with Beijing. Geo-politically, we are witnessing growing
rivalry between China and India, particularly in the era of weakening American
role in the region. A new type of big power relationship is emerging in the region
and relatively smaller countries like Bangladesh have to adjust with this changing
scenario, maintaining balanced economic and geo-political relations, particularly
with China and India.    
In this piece, I will focus on a number of issues that concern Mr. Xi's visit to
Bangladesh in particular, and China-Bangladesh relations in general. 
Xi Jinping: China's most powerful and popular leader since Deng 
President Xi is considered as the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng
Xioping, the architect of China's miraculous economic growth. Xi assumed the
Communist Party's leadership towards the end of 2012. Ever since he became the
Commander-in-Chief, Beijing has witnessed marked policy shift in terms of
leadership, economy and geo-politics. Given his command of all power, analysts
argue that President Xi has distanced himself from Deng and his successors'
practice of 'collective leadership', a governance paradigm based on accepted rules
and norms. 
Mr. Xi has changed the Chinese economic model, giving greater emphasis on
consumption, innovation and service led growth, shifting away from traditional
export and investment driven economic expansion. His fight against corruption,
particularly against political and business elites, is seen as one of the most
powerful campaigns in the country since the death of Mao Zedong. With
nationalistic fervour, he has been more assertive in dealing with geo-political
issues, de facto challenging America's supremacy in the Asia Pacific.
The Post-American South Asia: Living with the Dragon and the Elephant
There is no denying that the United States remains the top global power.
However, the nation is in relative decline. This is largely due to the rise of China
and a number of other emerging economies including India. The global
economy's shifting centre of economic gravity towards Asia is making China and
India two powerful economic engines as well as geo-political rivals. India is
visibly playing a greater role in South Asia, and Washington seems not too
unhappy, given its strategic alliance with New Delhi. China, which considers US
as its biggest rival in Asia and elsewhere in the world, is quietly celebrating
America's shrinking role in South Asia. 
Geo-political rivalry between the two Asian giants means Dhaka could face
mounting challenges in managing a balanced relation with them in years ahead.
Nevertheless, it is critical for Bangladesh to maintain balanced ties with India and
China, preserving the country's national interests. Too much alignment with a
single power risks the country becoming a vassal state.
Investment to get a big boost? 
Bangladesh's economic relations with China have traditionally been dominated by
trade. The former has not been benefited much by the latter's rapid expansion of
outward foreign investment. However, more and more synergies are emerging
between the two countries resulting in more Chinese investment in Bangladesh.
The country's steady urbanisation and six percent plus economic growth mean
that it is in need of huge funds and technical know-how to narrow its mounting
infrastructure deficit. It fares poorly in Asia's infrastructure ranking. Globally,
China invested about USD128 billion in 2015. Beijing showed huge interest to
invest in Bangladesh's port, railway, highway, energy sector and other key
infrastructure. President Xi's visit could be a game changer as far as China-
Bangladesh investment relation is concerned. 
USD 30 billion Bangladesh-China trade by 2021?
The two-way trade between China and Bangladesh reached about USD 12.5 billion
in 2014, according to the International Trade Centre. Bangladesh's exports growth
to China has averaged about 40 percent per annum in the past five years. On the
other hand, import growth averaged 23 percent annually. Going forward, under
even a conservative trade growth scenario, a back-of-the-envelope calculation
indicates that the two-way trade between the two countries could exceed USD 30
billion by 2021. 
While Bangladesh has been given duty free access to a large number of products
by Beijing, its export to China has not exceeded even one billion. Dhaka is likely
to demand more soft provisions to access the trillion dollars worth Chinese
consumer market. However, the fundamental drawback in this regard is that
Bangladesh has one of the narrowest export baskets in Asia. The large and
growing trade imbalance between the two countries can be reduced partly if
China invests in Bangladesh's industrial sector, particularly relocating some of its
low value added sun set industries. Goods produced in those industries could be
exported to China.
One Belt, One Road: Linking Bangladesh with Southeast- and East Asia
Historically, China has been well-connected with its immediate neighbours as
well as Europe, Middle East and Africa through the Silk Road for centuries.
Beijing intends to reestablish this historical connection, creating a vast network
of railway, energy pipelines, highways and modernising border points. Xi Jinping
is the mastermind behind China's flagship plan under the aegis of One Belt, One
Road (OBOR). About 70 countries have joined the project. Beijing is developing
new institutions and channeling funds, such as the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund, to support the largest undertaking
since America's Marshall Plan, implemented after World War II. 
The BCIM Economic Corridor, involving Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar,
is also a part of OBOR. However, the progress of BCIM has been less than
satisfactory, although its origin dates back to the 1990s, as China and India's
strategic rivalry has slowed down the pace of BCIM. Dhaka needs to employ its
diplomatic apparatus to integrate with China and other Southeast Asian
countries, taking the institutional advantages of OBOR in general and BCIM in
particular. Dhaka and Beijing should work closely to find ways Bangladesh can
access the most dynamic region of the world, i.e. East Asia, through Myanmar,
taking advantage of China's leverage over Naypyidaw. 
Ocean economy development in the world's largest bay
China's plan to revive the Maritime Silk Route (MSR) and development of
economic belts offer immense opportunities for Bangladesh. The plan of the 21st
century MSR coincides with Bangladesh's demarcation of its maritime boundary
with two of its Bay of Bengal neighbours - India and Myanmar. This gives the
country an opportunity to build a blue economy in the world's largest Bay.
However, given the massive undertaking, it requires the involvement of regional
as well as global powers to develop a modern ocean economy. 
China has expanded maritime cooperation in the area of ocean and climate
change, marine disaster prevention and mitigation and biodiversity preservation
with a number of countries. The China-ASEAN Marine Cooperation Center, the
Indonesia and China Centre for Ocean and Climate, the China-Pakistan Joint
Marine Center and the China-Sri Lanka Marine and Coastal Zone Joint Research
Centre are some examples of how the MSR regions have amplified maritime
cooperation. It is expected that both Dhaka and Beijing will sign agreements to
forge greater cooperation involving blue economy during Mr. Xi's visit to
Bangladesh.
The way forward 
Bangladesh's relation with China is not only important from an economic
perspective, it is equally critical to manage more balanced ties with regional and
global players, thereby minimising geo-political risks. In this pursuit, President
Xi Jinping's visit to Bangladesh could have far reaching implications.

Should Bangladesh worry about China's 'debt trap'? One needs to understand that to be a
developed country by 2041, Bangladesh needs to continue and successfully complete the
mega-development projects. The country also has the potential to become the economic
hub of the sub-continent. For this, Bangladesh needs external sources of funding.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/opinions/chinas-so-called-debt-trap-and-bangladesh-1603292664 1/8If the Chinese investment financing or loan deals are negotiated properly with competitive
interest rates, the project money is utilised correctly, and only the favourable bids are
accepted, then Bangladesh will be benefitted. For instance, the bridges that China has
financed and constructed in Bangladesh improve the physical communication network.
Nevertheless, in 2014, during the Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to China,
an agreement on the construction of Sonadia deep-sea port was supposed to be signed.
But China changed its stance from a soft loan to a commercial loan which resulted in the
cancellation of the deal. Thus, Bangladesh buried the Sonadia deep-sea port project.
China is recognised and acclaimed as 'all-weather' friend of Bangladesh. The geostrategic
location of Bangladesh makes it an important country for China's Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) project. And Bangladesh is a strong supporter of China's BRI project, which needs to
be appreciated from China's side. On March 22, 2016 Bangladesh joined China-led Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Since then AIIB has approved major infrastrucral and
developmental projects in Bangladesh which has contributed to the socio-economic
development of the country. AIIB-funded projects in transport, energy, health and water
bear broader direct implications to the everyday life of the people of Bangladesh. In fact, it
is not possible for many states including Bangladesh to finance all the development
projects with its own funding.
There are criticismsabout China's 'debt trap' in Africa. So, it is in China's interest that a new
example, Bangladesh is not cited as an example of China's 'debt trap' diplomacy.
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina mentioned that 'Bangladesh will never step into
a debt trap in my tenure' as the deals with China were properly negotiated. Bangladesh's
foreign loan to GDP rate rose to 14.3 per cent in 2019, which was 12 per cent in 2018. In the
case of Sri Lanka, the rate is 66 per cent while in the case of India, it is 34 per cent
(bdnews24.com, July 2, 2019). A debt-to-GDP ratio for African countries is 60 per cent.
It is often claimed that China is playing its 'debt trap diplomacy' which is the dominant
narratives in the Western media. There are also alternative narratives which are often
overlooked. For instance, in the case of China's engagement in Africa, MehariTaddeleMaru,
in his article 'Why Africa loves China' (2019) notes that 'Chinese soft loans have enabled
many African governments to avoid pressure from global governance institutions such as
IMF and World Bank to meet Western norms of accountability and conditionality related to
political and economic reforms, such as the infamous structural adjustment that does not
always serve the interest of Africans'.
So, before tagging China's 'debt trap' with Bangladesh, it is essential to examine what the
financing options for Bangladesh are. Is there any proper study whether China's funding
will be a curse or blessing for Bangladesh? The reality is that for low-middle-income25/05/2025, 11:22 China's so-called ''debt trap'' and Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/opinions/chinas-so-called-debt-trap-and-bangladesh-1603292664 2/8countries, the financing options are minimal. Bangladesh and its people will be benefitted
from China's investments in the development projects which are really important for the
continuation of the socio-economic development of Bangladesh. It is also crucial to ensure
that the loan agreements are appropriately negotiated, and the money is utilised correctly.

Bangladesh-China relations to reach a new height with
PM’s upcoming B eijing tour: CPC minister
DhakaPublished: 25 Jun 2024, 20: 32
The diplomatic relations between Bangladesh and China saw a significant qualitative rise
during China president Xi Jinping's official visit to Bangladesh in October 2016, said Liu
Jianchao, head of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
“Prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s upcoming visit to Beijing too will mark an exceptional
rise in the relations between the two countries,” he underscored.Diplomatic Correspondent

 Collected25/05/2025, 10:06 Bangladesh-China relations set to soar with PM Sheikh Hasina's Beijing tour: CPC minister
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/0m5bg4xhfl 1/4The CPC minister made the remarks while addressing a seminar organised by the Chinese
Embassy in Dhaka on the future of the relations between the two countries at a Dhaka
hotel Tuesday morning.
Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen was the moderator of the seminar.
Leaders of the governing Awami League, de facto opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) and several allies of the 14-party alliance, business leaders, former diplomats and
international analysts joined the seminar.
Liu Jianchao said, “The relations between the two countries gradually grew over time. It
reached the strategic level of development cooperation through the historic visit of
president Xi Jinping in 2016. We are looking forward to prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s
upcoming state visit to China. It will be her fifth visit to China as the prime minister and
the two leaders met each time.”
The senior CPC minister said the diplomatic ties between the two
countries reached a new height following the parliamentary elections in
Bangladesh.
Referring to the meeting between the two top leaders on the sidelines of the BRICS
Summit held in South Africa last year, he said they agreed on implementing high standard
projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Bangladesh is the first among the south
Asian countries to ink the MoU under the BRI.
He further said, “A total of 14 infrastructural projects have been implemented or are
underway under the BRI structure, including the Padma Bridge Rail Link project,
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel and the Dasherkandi sewerage project.
These projects have further strengthened the cooperation between the two countries.”
The senior CPC minister said the diplomatic ties between the two countries reached a new
height following the parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. China is always committed to
be a part of Bangladesh’s journey towards the path of development as an alternative
partner.
Speaking regarding the CPC Congress held in July last year, he said they were stressing on
strengthening relations with the political parties in allied countries.25/05/2025, 10:06 Bangladesh-China relations set to soar with PM Sheikh Hasina's Beijing tour: CPC minister
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/0m5bg4xhfl 2/4“We follow three policies to strengthen relations with the political parties. First, we don’t
prioritise the ideological aspects of political parties. As a result, China has friends across
the world. Second, we don’t consider whether the party is at the helm or not to establish
diplomatic relations with it. Third, we focus on common ground respecting each other’s
consent to reach a consensus with any political party.”
Addressing the seminar, the leader of the opposition in parliament and Jatiya Party (JaPa)
chairman GM Quader said, “Once there was a proposal to shift some Chinese factories,
which are dependent on unskilled or semi-skilled workers. China could reconsider the
proposal to enhance business between the two countries. Besides, China also can play an
active role to persuade Myanmar for Rohingya repatriation. The Rohingya crisis has
become a huge burden for Bangladesh now.”
Awami League international relations affairs secretary Shammi Ahmed said the
Bangladesh-China relationships grew a lot in the recent years. Politically, the cooperation
between the CPC and the AL is growing gradually. Awami League is the only party to sign a
MoU with the Communist Party of China.
A delegation of young Awami League leaders recently visited China. Another delegation of
senior Awami League leaders are scheduled to visit China in the coming days.
Speaking to Prothom Alo, international relations analyst professor Imtiaz Ahmed said,
“China has the scope to work on some specific projects in major sectors such as health
and education. Such projects will help continue the bilateral cooperation between the two
countries in the long run. In this case, a pilot project can be taken up by linking up 10
schools of Bangladesh with 10 Chinese schools. For the health sector, such pilot projects
can be taken up with 10 integrated health organisations. But we have to ensure that the
health agencies to be brought under these projects are not from Dhaka only.
Among the others, JSD president Hasanul Haq Inu, BNP leader air vice-marshal (retd)

x25/05/2025, 14:43 AidData: Bangladesh to remain a key battleground for great power competition
https://www.dhakatribune.com/financial-markets/331378/aiddata-bangladesh-to-remain-a-key-battleground 1/5US-based research lab AidData has analyzed Chinese investment in Bangladesh under the Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI) and said that the country will likely remain “a key battleground for
great power competition” in the coming years given its unique locational position and recent
geopolitical trends.
AidData, housed at William & Mary's Global Research Institute in Virginia, generates evidence
for policymakers and practitioners to improve how sustainable development investments are
targeted, monitored, and evaluated.
The report on the BRI comes as Beijing is celebrating the 10th anniversary of President Xi
Jinping’s signature initiative. Bangladesh was the first South Asian country to join the BRI in
2016.
AidData found that out of the total Chinese development finance portfolio of $20.79 billion
committed between 2000 and 2021 in Bangladesh, 19% was ODA (grants and highly
concessional loans) and 81% was OOF (other official sector loans).
Compared to only $175 million per year during the BNP era (2002-06), Chinese development
financing doubled to $381 million in Bangladesh during Sheikh Hasina’s first term (2009-14).
Since then, it has risen seven-fold to $2.2 billion (2014-2018) and $2.3 billion (2019-till date).
However, the research lab found that Bangladesh does not have any hidden debt exposure to
China, indicating that the likelihood of unaccounted-for (or implicit) liabilities on the government
of Bangladesh to Chinese official sector lenders is low.
But it was noted that the majority of the projects, 59%, are facing ESG - Environmental, Social,
or Governance – risks, a claim that Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen disagrees with.
Replying to a Dhaka Tribune question, the Ambassador recently at an event said he was aware of
the report and that he found a ""generally good assessment” of the BRI.
On the specific ESG risks, he said: “I can ensure all the projects China conducts with Bangladesh
on the BRI have had very strict environmental assessments. It was based on these feasibility
studies. All the projects are based on scientific and very strict environmental assessments. So I'm
quite sure so far all the projects are safe in terms of environmental factors.”

https://www.dhakatribune.com/financial-markets/331378/aiddata-bangladesh-to-remain-a-key-battleground 2/5Great power  competition
Given its unique locational position and recent geopolitical trends—including the rise of India
and growing Sino-US tensions in the South China Sea—Bangladesh will likely remain a key
battleground for great power competition in the coming years, said AidData.
From Dhaka’s vantage point, growing competition between China and the US in the Indo-Pacific
region only offers more opportunities for improving economic growth.
Its economy still needs diversification, such as through new competitive industries adjacent to its
dominant textile industry.
This will require investment, skills transfer, and further integration of existing industries into
global supply chains.
A deepening trade relationship with China, potentially through the planned rail link via Myanmar,
could increase economic prosperity through job creation, it said.
From the US perspective, its robust trade ties with Bangladesh and strong alliance with India
(Bangladesh’s most influential regional partner) may provide opportunities to make inroads.
“Yet recent events—including vote rigging, voter intimidation, the use of violence, and the
targeting of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus through the judicial system—have put
Washington in a tough position,” it said.
“As a defender of liberal democracies around the world, Washington may feel compelled to
condemn actions that would push Bangladesh further down the path of authoritarianism. On the
other hand, it cannot ignore the realpolitik consideration that China’s influence is expanding in
South and Southeast Asia.”
Early BRI period
During the early BRI period, China made modest media sentiment gains in Bangladesh at the
expense of the US.
It also dramatically increased the provision of aid and credit to Bangladesh during the late BRI
period.
Whereas average annual ODA and OOF commitments from China to Bangladesh were only $994
million between 2014 and 2017, this figure soared to $3.4 billion between 2018 and 2021.
x25/05/2025, 14:43 AidData: Bangladesh to remain a key battleground for great power competition
https://www.dhakatribune.com/financial-markets/331378/aiddata-bangladesh-to-remain-a-key-battleground 3/5“This unprecedented spending increase coincided with a period of political stability, particularly
after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won her second consecutive electoral victory in 2018. It also
coincided with a period of rising authoritarianism,” AidData summarised.
China’ s late BRI era foray into Bangladesh
In May 2021, Chinese Ambassador Li Jiming issued a stern warning to Bangladesh’s elites.
In response to reports that Dhaka might join the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad)—an
informal coalition between the US, Japan, Australia, and India—he said that such a move would
inflict “substantial damage” on Sino-Bangla relations.
“This uncharacteristically blunt remark provoked strong pushback from Bangladesh’s Foreign
Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen.”
“We are an independent and sovereign state. We decide our foreign policy,” he said.
He also clarified that Dhaka was neither approached by the members of the Quad nor was its
participation in the Quad a possibility under active consideration.
This diplomatic spat highlights Bangladesh’s desire to delicately balance relations with the US
and its closest regional partner (India) while bolstering its “strategic partnership” with China.
Bangladesh is located in the strategically vital Indo-Pacific region, serving as a gateway between
South Asia and Southeast Asia.
For China, it is an entry point to the Bay of Bengal, and its proximity to Myanmar increases its
strategic value to the US and its Quad allies.
Public debt exposur e, ESG risks
At $17.1 billion, Bangladesh’s public debt exposure to China is 4.1% of GDP, which is 6.9
percentage points below the global average in China’s portfolio.
“Bangladesh does not have any hidden debt exposure to China, showing the likelihood of
unaccounted for (or implicit) liabilities on the government of Bangladesh to Chinese official
sector lenders is low,” AidData said.
“Unlike countries like Pakistan and Argentina, Bangladesh has yet to receive any rescue loans
from China, indicating proactive debt management. This is likely due to the fact that Bangladesh

Kazi Anis Ahmed, Publisherhas not experienced debt distress in recent years.”
While only two projects have been suspended or cancelled, the majority (59%) are facing ESG
risks.
This includes the energy sector, where several high-profile coal-fired power plants were financed.
Only one-quarter of the portfolio is protected by strong ESG contract safeguards, indicating
higher risks of implementation challenges in the future, according to the report.
At 55% and 31% of the entire portfolio respectively, the Energy and Transport and Storage
sectors received the vast majority of Chinese development finance.
AidData said the proportion of this portfolio facing significant ESG risks has increased
dramatically, from $1 billion in 2015 to over $12 billion by 2021.
Since joining the BRI, according to the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka, Chinese investment in
Bangladesh has grown to $1.346 billion in 2022 from $241 million in 2016.  
Two-way trade was $22.8 billion in 2022, up from $15.3 billion in 2016. China has built 12
roads, 21 bridges, and 27 power and energy projects in Bangladesh, and 670 Chinese companies
have created more than 550,000 jobs.

ensure legal and compliant operations"".
He was speaking at a dialogue on ‘Bangladesh-China Relations: Prognosis for the Future’  in Dhaka
organised by the Cosmos Foundation.
He said the development of China-Bangladesh relations faces “unprecedented opportunities” for

science and technology , culture, education, and health, and carry out fruitful assistance programs for
people's livelihood centred around the construction of the Belt and Road,” he said.
With the aim to establish people-to-people connectivity , the ambassador said both countries should
continue to deepen cooperation in the fields of poverty reduction, local development, cities, and rural
governance, and strengthen collaborations in tourism, archaeology , heritage protection, and cultural and
creative industries.
“We should actively expand cooperation in new media, news, film and television, tell more exciting and

than last year , with China remaining the number one trade partner to Bangladesh.
The engineering contracts signed between Bangladesh and Chinese companies reached 10.4 billion
dollars, second in the South Asian region.
In the first nine months of this year , the bilateral trade value stands at $13.9 billion, with a growth rate of
19.3 percent year on year .
The contracts signed are worth $3.84 billion, number one in South Asia and number four globally , the
ambassador said.

The Economic Belt focuses on bringing together China, Central Asia, Russia and Europe (the Baltic),
linking China with the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea through Central Asia and W est Asia, and
connecting China with Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Indian Ocean.
The Maritime Silk Road is designed to go from China’ s coast to Europe through the South China Sea and
the Indian Ocean on one route, and from China’ s coast through the South China Sea to the South Pacific

China-Mongolia-Russia, China-Central Asia-W est Asia and China-Indochina Peninsula economic corridors
by taking advantage of international transport routes.
This will also be closely related to the BCIM and China-Pakistan economic corridor , according to the plan
and therefore China sought “closer cooperation”.
China, however , believes the initiative is an “ambitious” economic vision, and thus urged countries “to work
together in concert and move towards the objectives of mutual benefit and common security”.
“To be specific, they need to improve the region’ s infrastructure, and put in place a secure and ef ficient
network of land, sea and air passages.”
Bangladesh strongly supports China’ s economic corridor , and road and belt initiative, though those are
being seen as steps to expand its influence in the region by many .25/05/2025, 11:25 China unveils plans on building Silk Road Economic Belt, 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road

active participation of all countries and international and regional organisations in this initiative”.
“It features mutual respect and trust, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, and mutual learning between

Is there any trade potential for Bangladeshi leather goods and commodities?
Of course, Bangladesh has a great deal of prospects to increase its leather exports to the
countries of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). 
This article argues that the leather sector could boost Bangladesh's exports diversification
strategy to reduce the country’s overdependence on the ready-made garments (RMG)
sector.
A clear-eyed strategy to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and maritime
networks, the BRI’s primary goals are regional integration and stimulating trade and
economic growth.
As of December 2021, the number of countries that have joined the Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China is 145.
Bangladesh is a founding member of China’s BRI. 
The BRI aims to establish cooperation in five major areas: trade and investment
facilitation; policy coordination; infrastructure development and connectivity; financial
coordination and integration; people-to-people ties and connectivity.
The trade and investments in the BRI countries have been booming in recent years. 
The leather industry is one of the traditional export-oriented industries of South Asia,
employing a large number of people from both organized as well as unorganized sectors
and engaging predominantly micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.
From 1970, it has become a sizable industry.
Nowadays, it is one of the major industries in Bangladesh.
With an estimated total population of 167 million, Bangladesh had a comparative
advantage in this industry, compared with similar-sized countries, such as Vietnam.Publish : 24 Mar 2022, 07:39 PM
x25/05/2025, 14:55 The potential of Bangladeshi leather export along the belt and road initiative
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/266338/the-potential-of-bangladeshi-leather-export-along 2/8Over 200 government verified leather processing plants are present for rawhides wet blue,
crust, or finished leather.
Moreover, over 2,000 leather footwear and leather production plants manufacture varieties
of goods, such as footwear, garments, handbags, luggage, wallets, and other luxury items. 
Estimates
According to the Bangladesh Commerce Ministry, Bangladesh can earn more than $5
billion by exporting leather and leather goods annually. 
The Commerce Ministry has launched a project titled ""Export Competitiveness for Jobs
(EC4J)"" to help boost the country's export earnings from leather and leather products, light
engineering, footwear, and plastics sectors.
There is a huge demand for Bangladeshi leather and leather products in different countries.
Within the tanning industry, a highly differentiated network of tanneries and
intermediaries has emerged, giving an account of differing capabilities and strong internal
hierarchies.
Bangladesh Tanners Association (BTA) is a non-profit association of leather industry in
Bangladesh.
It plays an important role in various aspects such as the issue of export certificates, liaison
with the government departments in regards to the development of the leather sector.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/266338/the-potential-of-bangladeshi-leather-export-along 3/8The leather industry has been struggling for the past two years, especially since the
outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, due to a lack of new investment, poor product variety,
artificial leather penetration, a price hike on leather products, and a lack of vigilance on
behalf of the tannery estates.
Exporters also blamed the US-China trade war for the two-year slump.
In 2019, the global market for leather and leather goods is $251.77 billion.
Bangladesh produces 350 million square feet of leather annually, which accounted for about
1% of the world’s total leather exports.
It is commonly stated that the inflows of foreign exchange and the expansion of the import
of services/capital goods, which are two essential elements of economic growth and
productivity improvement, could be enlarged progressively through export growth.
Export is an important activity for an emerging economy like Bangladesh.
x25/05/2025, 14:55 The potential of Bangladeshi leather export along the belt and road initiative
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/266338/the-potential-of-bangladeshi-leather-export-along 4/8Along with an economic growth trend of over 6% in the last decade, almost 90% of
Bangladeshi exported goods are readymade garments or RMG products.
The entire manufacturing sector is thus reliant upon one sector-RMG.
The number of RMG factories in Bangladesh has declined in the last 10 years.
Reducing RMG dependency and product diversification would be the next step that can be
further understood by various policies and indicators of Bangladesh's government.
Bangladesh would have an upper hand in the leather industry, particularly due to the
country's huge number of laborers.
The country is now experiencing a demographic dividend.
In the fiscal year of 2017, the leather industry accounted for 3.5% of Bangladesh’s annual
exports of $1.2 billion, i.e. about 0.6% of the global export market.
Bangladesh’s goods and service exports grew from $5 billion in 1990 to more than $46
billion in 2019.
Joining the World Trade Organization in 1995 allowed Bangladesh to gain the tariff-free
benefit and the export expansions being a developing country.
Since then, Bangladesh's gross domestic product (GDP) has been soaring, particularly since
2004.
During the catastrophic event of the global financial crisis, the record slowdown of global
trade in the year 2015 to 2016, the world's export performance fell about $3.1 trillion,
declining export revenue of the good number of countries where Bangladesh has been on
steady export growth.
As of 2020, Bangladesh is one of the countries on track for graduating from their lower-
income to middle-income countries.
The international market, especially for RMG exports, had been playing an important role
as one of the major engines for this success.
To address the economic crisis and slowdown, the seventh five-year plan of 2016-2020 has
an emphasis on export diversification, particularly in the leather industry.
Global leather trade fetches 150 billion US$ annually.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/266338/the-potential-of-bangladeshi-leather-export-along 5/8China extended the duty-free access to 97% of Bangladeshi goods in 2020.
However, Bangladesh could not seize the opportunity for most of last year because of a lack
of diversified goods and the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
The duty benefit was extended to Bangladesh at a time when China's consumer market is
set to expand by 12% every year to reach $8.4 trillion by 2022.
Because of its vast population, the Chinese consumer market will overtake America's by
2034. 
Chinese dominance
In the BRI document delivered by the Chinese government, the 21st-century Maritime Silk
Road (MSR) and the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) are two separate parts, and trade
and investment are focal words.
The value of China’s overseas investment and construction combined has exceeded $1.6
trillion.
Exporting to Chinese markets and using network connectivity to boost trade with other
participating countries in this BRI would create considerable growth potentials for
Bangladesh as well as other South Asian countries.
The capital flows and transport cost reductions related to the BRI are fast becoming a
reality.
Evidence suggests that the BRI has the potential to deliver significant welfare gains,
particularly if combined with other trade integration schemes, and to counterbalance
aggressive trade policies particularly in light of the uncertainty created by the China-US
trade war.
China is a technologically sophisticated country in Asia.
The transfer of technology could, therefore, be an important area of cooperation.
Thus, bilateral trade cooperation between China and Bangladesh could help Bangladesh
leather exports to grow and flourish.
Bangladesh is likely to face some challenges.
x25/05/2025, 14:55 The potential of Bangladeshi leather export along the belt and road initiative
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/266338/the-potential-of-bangladeshi-leather-export-along 6/8For example, the implementation of the WTO agreement after the year 2000 reduces or
eliminates the quotas for the garment exports.
Bangladesh will face huge competition from countries like Vietnam or China, and will need
to upgrade its export trade to more sophisticated segments of the market, which requires
greater skills and increased productivity.
In fact, Bangladesh could chase for the comparative advantage in the leather industry
through the efficient utilization of its abundant population of 167 million.
To this end, human resource development is a vital prerequisite. 
The leather industry of Bangladesh is still suffering from high trade costs or transportation
costs. Higher transaction costs hamper trade facilitation in South Asia.
Research shows that a 10% fall in transaction costs at borders has the effect of increasing a
country’s exports by about 2%.
Among the major causes of high-trade transaction costs in South Asia are the cumbersome
and complex cross-border trading practices, which also increase the possibility of
corruption.
The government of Bangladesh should pay its attention to the development of the leather
sector by formulating policies and programs to minimize the trade and transportation
costs. 
The leather industry experts could focus on the main issues and determinants that might
help facilitate export promotions.
The wellbeing of the leather sector workers should be ensured through minimum wages,
decent environment and human rights protection.
The earnings gained from the exports of leather goods and commodities could profitably be
utilized in the socioeconomic developments and people’s wellbeing.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), reminiscent of the Silk Road, is a long-term
infrastructural project that would stretch from the heart of China, all the way to Europe
which will help Asia cope with infrastructure financing gaps.
This was echoed by President of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS)
Major General ANM Muniruzzaman and Editor of Dhaka Tribune Zafar Sobhan in their
remarks at the BIPSS-Dhaka Tribune Roundtable titled, 'Belt and Road Initiative (BRI):
Connecting the World', which was held at the Westin, reports UNB.
The BRI project of China will create partnership linkages among the sub-regions of South
Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. BRI presents an array of opportunities for
Bangladesh, they said.
The roundtable was attended by diplomats, scholars, security experts, and youth
representatives from various disciplines.
BIPSS President Muniruzzaman highlighted the key facets and variables concerning BRI, the
underlying opportunities and challenges, and what it means for Bangladesh to maintain a
strategic balance being a member of the grand infrastructural initiative.
He said BRI is happening at a time when significant changes are taking place in the
international system, according to a media release issued on Monday.
Zafar Sobhan, editor of The Dhaka Tribune, in his welcome remarks said it is important to
take a deeper look at BRI projects, including how they may affect Bangladesh.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/belt-and-road-initiative-to-create-partnership-linkages-roundtable-1640002749 1/5Muniruzzaman further discussed how Bangladesh has a significant geostrategic role in BRI.
“We expect that BRI projects shouldnʼt cause any harm to the environment,” he added.
While discussing the project of the century, Muniruzzaman focused on how BRI
encompasses several continents in a network of roads and sea-routes.
The first keynote speaker, Dr. Fahmida Khatun, Executive Director of Centre for Policy
Dialogue (CPD), began her remarks with an emphasis on the economic and trade benefits
of BRI, and its implications for Bangladesh.
During her speech, she also highlighted the infrastructural gap currently existing in
Bangladesh and BRI will be a key supplement to fulfilling this gap.
Fahmida Khatun said it is imperative for Bangladesh to follow a cautious approach
regarding Chinese investments.
Highlighting the role of BRI member countries, second keynote speaker Parvez Karim
Abbasi, Assistant Professor of the Department of Economics at East West University, began
his deliberations by talking about the geo-economic implications of BRI for the region.
He also highlighted the fact how the whole project of BRI is actually an integral part of the
Chinese socioeconomic identity.
Abbasi added, “BRI is a concrete manifestation of Chinaʼs emergence as an economic
powerhouse and it will help expand connectivity transcending the borders between
nations.”
He said the fate of China is intrinsically linked to BRI. ""Due to the pandemic, thereʼve been
major economic implications for the world. The small states need to take each step with
precision and clarity. The role of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has to be
studied with in-depth details.""
Summarizing the discussion, Muniruzzaman said although there will be major implications
for the signatory countries, they need to utilise the funds channeled through BRI for the
prosperity of our nation.
An interactive session with the audience was followed who further enriched the discussion.
The participants included foreign diplomats, security sector personnel, scholars and
journalists.

Premier Ding Xuexiang told Yunus, adding that China hopes Bangladesh will prosper and grow
under his leadership.
President Xi Jinping and Yunus are scheduled to hold bilateral talks at the Great Hall of China in
the Chinese capital city on Friday.
The executive vice premier said his country will fund modernisation efforts of Mongla port and
the Dasherkandi Sewage project.
The two countries also agreed to boost investment, trade and cultural ties and people-to-people
exchanges as they mark 50 years since the establishment of their diplomatic relationships.
The Chinese vice premier met Yunus on the sidelines of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual
Conference in the coastal Chinese town, and the two leaders also led a bilateral meeting between

Speakers at a business networking event said Bangladesh needs more Chinese market-
oriented investment in the country to boost its exports in the market of China.
They said bilateral financial and currency cooperation is strongly recommended to help
facilitate trade and economic cooperation.
The speakers also said China can help Bangladesh resolve many geopolitical issues.
They came up with the remarks at the ""China-Bangladesh Enterprises Cooperation Forum
2022,"" at Bangabandhu Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center (BBCFEC) at
Purbachal in the capital.
State Minister of Planning Dr. Shamsul Alam joined as the chief guest at the event, jointly
organised by the Bangladesh China Chamber of Commerce & Industry (BCCCI) and the
Chinese Enterprises Association in Bangladesh (CEAB).
In his address, Dr. Alam said China needs to enhance the relationship on some areas
including trade visits, cultural visits, people to people relations and many more.
""There are rooms for accelerating relationship on renewable energy, technology and
educational scholarships,"" he said.BN25/05/2025, 15:24 Dhaka needs market-oriented investment from Beijing | The Financial Express

technological support from the country to expand Bangladesh's economy.
Noting that Dhaka is enjoying duty-free access of 99 per cent of products in the Chinese
market, he, however, emphasised on forming a comprehensive economic partnership
between the two countries and signing the FTA.
He also said Bangladesh wants influx of more FDI from China.
""We built dedicated economic zone for Chinese investors,"" he said adding Beijing can help
Bangladesh in resolving many geopolitical issues.
Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Li Jiming and immediate past Bangladesh ambassador to
China Mahbub Uz Zaman were present as special guests at the event, chaired by BCCCI
President Gazi Golum Murtoza.
CEAB President Ke Changlian and BCCCI Acting General Secretary Al Mamun Mridha
delivered the welcome speeches.
In his speech, Mr Li Jiming said that China-Bangladesh bilateral relationship is strong,
complementary and growing.
""Our economic and political ties are vast and robust,"" he noted.
He said since China and Bangladesh established formal diplomatic relations, the two
countries have been sharing broad success for cooperation in areas such as agriculture,
trade, marine affairs, climate change, infrastructure, urban management and poverty
alleviation.
""Remarkable progress has been achieved in these key areas,"" he observed.
Under the Belt and Road Initiative, he said China has signed more than 200 collaboration
documents with 149 countries and 32 international organisations.
As of the first half of this year, China's trade in goods with countries involved in the BRI
totaled $11.8 trillion and its nonfinancial direct investment in these countries exceeded
$140 billion, the Chinese ambassador said.
By the way, he said it is learnt that Chinese direct investment in Bangladesh has increased
by 300 per cent and China has promised to invest more $40 billion into joint ventures and
infrastructure projects through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).25/05/2025, 15:24 Dhaka needs market-oriented investment from Beijing | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/dhaka-needs-market-oriented-investment-from-beijing-1664074522 2/7The envoy said China continuously supports Bangladesh through various means to
promote the infrastructure development, including concessional loans, investment
cooperation, project contracting and China-aid projects.
Acknowledging that Dhaka needed more Chinese market-oriented investment, he said ""We
recommend Bangladesh's enterprises and exporters participate in China's International
Import Exposition (CIIE).""
""Bangladesh needs to produce what the Chinese market needs in order to boost export,"" he
added.
BCCCI President Gazi Golum Murtoza said due to worldwide pandemic followed by Ukrain
War, the exchange rate of US dollar has become out of control as it keeps on rising and
rising.
As Bangladesh and China account for an average annual basket of trade worth US dollar 15
billion, he said such dependency on US dollar leads to a perilous loss both for Bangladesh
and China.
BCCCI Acting General Secretary Al Mamun Mridha said, ""We have worked vigorously as the
catalyst to promote and facilitate trade and investment between two friendly countries
through different channels and activities.
From year 2003 to 2022 the bilateral trade jumped from $1.17 billion to more than $15
billion, he added.

In Monday’s section, Ambassador Li discusses the alignment of China’s Belt and Road Initiative
with Bangladesh’s Vision 2041 and the role China plays in Bangladesh’s development
How will China str engthen the alignment of its Belt
and Road Initiative with Bangladesh’ s Vision 2041 in
near  futur e? How many development pr ojects in
Bangladesh ar e funded by China? What ar e the key
projects?
Bangladesh’s Vision 2041 perspective plan provides road-map for accelerating growth and lays
down broad approaches for eradication of poverty, inequality, and human deprivation. By
implementing the plan, Bangladesh is expected to make rapid change in agriculture, trade and
industry, education, health care, transportation and communication, etc.
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the right venue for tangible and intangible outcomes pertinent to
innovative, harmonized, green, open, high-quality and shared developments, which protects and
maintains peace and promotes people's well-being in the post COVID-19 era. 
BRI is proposed by China, but not owned exclusively by China. Ever since its genesis, BRI has
been aiming at integrating with development strategies of all parties interested. Bangladesh is one
of the first countries to respond to BRI and an important participant thereof. By far, Bangladesh
has become one of the countries with most cooperation and fruitful results under the BRI
framework.
Also Read: ‘Belt and Road Initiative and Vision 2041 to integrate further’
As strategic partners of cooperation, it is natural for Bangladesh and China to coordinate and
integrate development strategies. We have established the Joint Economic and Trade Committee
as an institutional arrangement for economic and trade cooperation. 
x25/05/2025, 14:46 ‘By far, Bangladesh has become one of the countries with most cooperation and fruitful results under the BRI framework’
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/293097/‘by-far-bangladesh-has-become-one-of-the 2/4According to data from China, the bilateral trade between China and Bangladesh increased
significantly in 2021, exceeding 25 billion US dollars. The turnover of China's contracted
projects to Bangladesh remained in the forefront of South Asian countries, and China's
investment in Bangladesh increased by more than 290% year-on-year.
To further enhance integration of development strategies, the two sides could work together in the
following aspects:
First, we need to further strengthen political mutual trust, consolidate the foundation for win-win
results, enhance risk management and control, and secure the cooperation environment against
the rapidly changing international situation.
Second, we need to further enhance inter-governmental cooperation and promote the
implementation of major projects. After Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Bangladesh in
2016, a series of major projects have been progressing smoothly and are expected to be
completed by the end of 2024. 
Third, we need to fully utilize the high-quality projects and expand the volume of cooperation,
such as the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center, the zero-tariff treatment for 98% of
Bangladeshi products exported to China, and the large-scale international exhibitions like the
China International Import Expo and the Canton Fair.
Fourth, we need to explore new opportunities and cultivate new growth points. Specifically, we
can promote PPP cooperation, advance studies on bilateral FTA, jointly respond to pandemic and
climate change, restore rivers, develop green and low-carbon energies, and work on digital
economy.
China is the largest pr oducer  of electricity fr om

scale of hydropower, wind power, photovoltaic power and biomass power has been the world's
largest for 17 years, 12 years, 7 years, and 4 years respectively. 
China and Bangladesh have broad scope for cooperation and development in the field of
renewable energy. Against the backdrop of the global response to climate change and accelerated
energy transition, it is necessary for China and Bangladesh to strengthen cooperation on global
energy governance, promote healthy development of global energy governance system, and make
positive contributions to the response to climate change.

problem only Bangladesh was facing. “It's a global issue. You see the conflict. One is in Ukraine,
the other is in the Middle East and the uncertain international financial situation and the high
interest rate"".
All these together contributed to the difficulty faced by “your country and other countries,"" he
said.
""I should say compared with the other Asian neighbours, Bangladesh still stands out in terms of
financial stability.""
“So definitely that is our expectation that maybe next year the situation will turn better,"" he said.

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been a pivotal force in infrastructure development
for the developing world, especially the emerging economies. In September 2013, China's
President Xi announced the One Belt and One Road Initiative (OBOR), which later became
titled as the BRI. This year marks the 10th anniversary of this initiative that continues to beBN
25/05/2025, 11:05 BRI - 10 years on, and Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/bri-10-years-on-and-bangladesh 1/9implemented across the world raising a multitude of discourses, both critical and positive,
centred around it.
The BRI has emerged as one of the world's most ambitious and debated development
initiatives. Of the over USD one trillion investment, a large portion of which is directed
towards traditional infrastructure, including transport (e.g., roads, railways) and energy, is a
key element of planning and implementing these emerging economies' growth and
progress objectives. As of now, 148 countries have signed memorandums of understanding
(MoUs) with China regarding the BRI. These agreements indicate a desire to collaborate
with China on the initiative's five pillars, which include investment, trade, and 'people-to-
people' exchanges. Despite Italy's 2023 announcement to exit the BRI, most of Asia, Africa,
and significant parts of Latin America remain steadfast in their support. The Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated earlier that the BRI would
likely add $1 trillion in funding across the world between 2017 and 2027; the World Bank
estimates that between 2013 and 2018 BRI investment including energy projects was about
$575 billion. African countries praise the project, whereas countries like India and the US
accused China of engaging in 'debt trap diplomacy' - aiming to own countries' assets if they
are unable to repay the loans. Bangladesh has not been immune to this discussion as well.
As various organisations in Bangladesh continue discussing the merits and demerits of the
BRI, the Centre for Alternatives recently held a similar event, where the issue of debt trap
was discussed comprehensively. It must be concluded that the West-painted narrative of
the Chinese debt trap has very different sources that the western influenced media would
have one believe. Underscoring the fact that the term ""debt trap"" is a politically coined with
origins arguably attributed to either Indian or US sources. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka (SL) is
primed as the key example of Chinese debt trap, and the media discourse strengthens this
narrative extensively. However, deeper, and objective analysis for the heavy foreign debt
burden on SL was international capital market borrowing (mainly for infrastructure
development) that began in earnest following the end of the civil was in SL. This type of
borrowing accounted for about 47 per cent of the foreign debt that had strict repayment
schedules. If WB and ADB borrowings are added, it accounts for about 69 per cent of SL's
foreign borrowing. Internal policies, prime one to exacerbate the situation was agriculture
policy of SL, weakened the SL situation further, drowning SL in a situation for which China
was allegedly and incorrectly convicted of being responsible. Bangladesh is undergoing its
own financial difficulties and mismanagement conundrums, but the Chinese investments
are not seemingly the cause for it. Bangladesh's internal corruption nexus is likely the
reason for unfathomable increase in the prices of the mega projects that China has funded,
and of course, the Chinese counterparts are likely to have catalysed the corruption by
encouraging it further. However, the way the BRI projects are funded does not seem like a
debt trap. The policymakers, and the implementers' mismanagement of funds and project25/05/2025, 11:05 BRI - 10 years on, and Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/bri-10-years-on-and-bangladesh 2/9implementation may cause financial challenges in the mid to long run, but the BRI funding
at its core does not promote any instability.
The five pillars of BRI that include policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded
trade, financial integration, and people-to-people contact-building supplemented with the
political commitment that a fund recipient country needs to have, all these structurally
make the BRI pivot on stability. Added to the challenge of it being from China that causes
geopolitical stress to the West and the US mainly, the investment recipients must have an
internal stability, and the Chinese policy makers also need to base their funding decisions
that afford stability to the host country. This is with the caveat that building infrastructure is
never risk-free. Any large initiative like the BRI having thousands of infrastructure projects
will have many failures as well as success stories. India, and later several others have
pointed out issues concerning debt trap, lack of transparency and sustainability of BRI
projects. The encouraging feature is China has modified some of its funding in Africa to
include green financing, showing that China is open to adapt to the needs of the time.
In Bangladesh, Chinese investments, and its future investment commitments have certainly
fostered economic growth towards its probable potential. The Chinese investments, as well
as the US, South Korean, Russian, and other investments have certainly emboldened
Bangladesh's economic growth and financial stability in the last decade. Of course,
financial mismanagement and corruption in the process of implementing these projects
and fund management is certainly a grave concern, but our own internal vulnerabilities are
more culpable for these situations to occur.
Under the BRI, Bangladesh is to receive $26 billion and $14 billion for joint venture projects,
totaling a $40 billion package. Bangladesh has primarily seen BRI projects in the energy and
transportation sectors, with infrastructure investment needs projected to reach 1.5 per cent
of GDP by 2040. Padma Bridge, Metrorail, Karnaphuli Tunnel have been the key feathers in
China-Bangladesh bilateral engagement's success caps. The 12 highways and 21 bridge
projects, symbolised by the Padma Multipurpose Bridge, serve as extensions of the
modern-day 'Silk Road' within Bangladesh. From road to rail to seaport and airport, under-
river tunnel to elevated expressway, water utility to e-governance, military, coal to solar
energy, China makes its presence felt everywhere in Bangladesh with funds, technology,
and expertise. In the last 10 years, China has released $4.45 billion for 35 projects under the
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), informs the Chinese Ambassador. Not only that, according to
the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a US think tank, the total investment from China in
Bangladesh is $7.07 billion. In addition, Chinese companies have received construction
contracts worth $22.94 billion in different sectors. These Chinese investments generate
about 550,000 employments in Bangladesh. Given the trajectory, China is likely to surpass
the US and become the largest investor in Bangladesh soon. This may raise several
eyebrows in the Western bloc, and the media would have a field day, doing its usual war25/05/2025, 11:05 BRI - 10 years on, and Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/bri-10-years-on-and-bangladesh 3/9games exercise of analysing how this would translate into the ongoing US-China global
competition, or global war as they would imply it.
However, the current world and the evolved globalisation underscores a different reality as
the media machinery would have one perceive. Ideas such as de-coupling, aligning with
one power over the other, and more are real, but their manifestation are less vivid and
concerning as the media would have it. The India-China trade relations, the way US and
other countries industries still depend on the Chinese manufacturing, this does not signify
the dichotomous assessment that media, propagandists, and alarmists would have one
believe. The mere fact is that globalisation has evolved from an interconnected information
nexus, and marketplace to an interdependent production network. Each product is now
made not only in place, or all its materials sourced from one place, rather a conglomeration
of production mechanisms, and material sourcing from across multiple nations is a norm
now. This situation creates interdependence among competing states and does not allow
them to completely de-couple and disengage from each other. This simple realisation does
not allow any country to look at things in the form of ""either with us or against us."" It was
tried once in the early 2000s, and it failed miserably, as it did during the cold war. This
realisation and central strategic point in Bangladesh's diplomacy and foreign affairs has
allowed the country to maneuver the geopolitical challenges, successfully maintaining the
country's foreign policy of friendship to all, malice to none. Bangladesh has successfully
and boldly made everyone understand that ""your enemy is your enemy, not mine; my
friend may be your enemy, but it does not affect my friendship with you."" Bangladesh has
aptly maneuvered and avoided the dichotomy that many, especially the media would have
made one believe that exists in the world.
We are now seen as a key participant not only in geoeconomics, but also geopolitics of this
region, and the world. This has allowed Bangladesh the opportunity to become a key nexus
of engagement, alignment, and adaptability between the Indo-Pacific Strategies of many,
and the Chinese BRI. It should be noted that none of the IPS signify Bangladesh as a priority
country; in fact, none of them even mention Bangladesh. However, the BRI does give
importance to Bangladesh significantly. Thus, for Bangladesh to have greater focus on BRI
not only for the importance of it renders to Bangladesh, but also the funds that it commits
to Bangladesh, is nothing but logical.
Thus, Bangladesh should continue giving extra focus on any BRI projects underscoring the
benefits, and how quickly and efficiently the repayment of loans can be made. There
should a higher degree of 1.5 diplomatic engagements among the Chinese and Bangladesh
intelligentia, and academia to forge better understanding of the BRI, and its projects in
Bangladesh that will not only benefit Bangladesh, but the whole region, and especially
India for its regional connectivity priorities. Making BRI projects more transparent,25/05/2025, 11:05 BRI - 10 years on, and Bangladesh | The Financial Express

be the key focus.

https://en.prothomalo.com/international/china/oalnd4gjfq 1/2Editor & Publisher: Matiur Rahman Copyright © 1998-2025 Prothom AloBut the initiative has also been slammed for saddling poor countries with enormous debt.
Xi announced on Wednesday that key Belt and Road lenders the China Development Bank
and the Export-Import Bank will now offer an additional $100 billion in loans.
Both will set up financing opportunities of 350 billion yuan ($47.9 billion) for BRI
projects, he said.
An additional 80 billion yuan will be injected into the project's official lending institution,
the Silk Road fund, Xi said.
This week's forum, attended by representatives of 130 countries, is the third major
summit of its kind to be hosted by Beijing since the Belt and Road's launch in 2013.
Critics have long pointed to opaque pricing for BRI projects built by Chinese companies,
with countries including Malaysia and Myanmar renegotiating deals to bring down costs.
Beijing has been forced to hand out billions of dollars in bailout loans to BRI countries in
recent years to allow the countries to extend their loans and remain solvent, according to
a joint report this year by the World Bank and other institutions.
And China said this month that BRI participants owe more than $300 billion to the
Export-Import Bank of China.
The initiative has also drawn scrutiny for its massive carbon footprint and the
environmental degradation caused by massive infrastructure projects.

At the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina started
her China visit on July 8. This is her first visit to China after taking office and her second visit to
China in five years. Last August, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Hasina during the

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/351714/a-deepening-friendship 1/4The frequent high-ranking visits between the two top leaders of China and Bangladesh reflect the
high degree of mutual trust. It is also an important manifestation of the new vitality of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (the Five Principles) in the new era.
PM Hasina’s visit comes shortly after the successful convening of the conference marking the
70th Anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence held in Beijing on June 28.
Seventy years ago, more than 20 Asian and African countries gathered in Bandung and proposed
10 principles for handling interstate relations, advocating the Bandung spirit of unity, friendship,
and cooperation.
Over the past 70 years, the Five Principles have been embraced by an ever-growing number of
countries, evolving into open, inclusive, and universally applicable basic norms of international
relations and fundamental principles of international law, guiding the continuous advancement of
China-Bangladesh relations.
During her meeting with President Xi Jinping last August, Prime Minister Hasina stated that the
excellent relations between Bangladesh and China were based on mutual respect and
noninterference in each other’s internal affairs.
Over the past 49 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China has not only
refrained from meddling in Bangladesh’s internal affairs but also opposed external interference,
jointly safeguarding each other’s core interests.
During Bangladesh’s parliamentary election earlier this year, China consistently adhered to the
principle of noninterference and fully respected the choice of the Bangladeshi people. In contrast,
on the eve of the election, the US Department of State called for fair, just, transparent, and
democratic elections in Bangladesh. After PM Hasina’s victory in the election, the US
Department of State criticized the election as not being free and fair.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/351714/a-deepening-friendship 2/4This led to PM Hasina’s public statement in May 2024 where she revealed that she was offered a
“smooth return to power” in exchange for leasing the country’s land for a foreign airbase.
Although she did not disclose the name of the country that made the offer, it is widely believed
that the offer would have come from the United States.
Over the past 49 years, China-Bangladesh cooperation has continued to deepen, with mutually
beneficial and win-win outcomes. China has remained Bangladesh’s largest trading partner and
the largest source of imports for 13 consecutive years, and it is also an important source of raw
materials for Bangladesh’s manufacturing industry. Moreover, Bangladesh is China’s second
largest trading partner in South Asia.
 Since Bangladesh joined the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2016, bilateral trade between
China and Bangladesh has grown from $15.3 billion in 2016 to $27.8bn in 2022, reaching a new
historical high.
China is also Bangladesh’s second largest source of foreign investment. Since 2016, the stock of
Chinese investment in Bangladesh has soared from $241m to $1.346bn in 2022. As of September
2023, the total amount of Chinese investment in Bangladesh reached $3.17bn, with 21 bridges
and 27 power projects implemented in the country. A large number of flagship projects, such as
the Padma Bridge and the Dasherkandi Sewage Treatment Plant, have been successfully
completed, providing a boost to Bangladesh’s economic development.
Currently, more than 670 Chinese enterprises are investing and operating in Bangladesh, driving
employment for over 550,000 locals and benefiting the local population with the dividends of
development. According to Bangladeshi scholars, in recent years, there has been a surge in the
number of Chinese enterprises investing in Bangladesh, and the number of Chinese people in
Bangladesh has increased significantly. This has made Bangladesh a new “hot land” for Chinese
investment in South Asia.
There are also high expectations for PM Hasina’s China trip, both among Chinese and
Bangladeshi experts. It is hoped that China’s Global Development Initiative (GDI) will push
forward China-Bangladesh trade and investment cooperation to a new level and enhance
Bangladesh’s transportation, power, and energy infrastructure, as well as its digital economy and
blue economy development.
We also look forward to promoting the strategic docking of China’s GDI, BRI, and Bangladesh’s
“Vision 2041” and the dream of “Shonar Bangla,” thereby making more robust economic ties

for both sides.
Due to the fierce strategic confrontation between China and the United States, China and
Bangladesh have also strengthened their policy communication on several international and
regional issues based on their common interests. In April 2023, Bangladesh announced its “Indo-
Pacific Outlook,” distancing itself from the United States’ “Indo-Pacific Strategy.” This reflects a
neutral position of Bangladesh amid China-US competition rather than a swing to the US.
Two months later, Bangladesh officially applied to join the BRICS, a fast-growing global
organization founded by China, Russia, India, Brazil, and South Africa. In response, China has
expressed full support for Bangladesh’s early admission as a new member of the BRICS.
Under China’s diplomatic mediation, Bangladesh and Myanmar signed an agreement on the
repatriation of Rohingya refugees in 2017. During the past seven years, Bangladesh has made
great contributions to jointly solving the Rohingya crisis. As the Chinese ambassador to
Bangladesh Yao Wen said, China understands and sympathizes with the tremendous costs that
Bangladesh has borne regarding the Rohingya issue and strives to restart the repatriation process
for Rohingya refugees.

Last update on: Tue Oct 15, 2024 12:46 AM
Foreign Adviser M Touhid Hossain yesterday said Dhaka is keen on strengthening
economic and security cooperation with China and deepening collaboration in
several critical areas, including clean energy and infrastructure development.
""We need security cooperation from China,"" he said while speaking at a seminar

Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) and the Centre
for China Studies (SIIS-DU) jointly organised the seminar, with Dhaka and Beijing
set to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic relations next year.
Underlining the significance of defence cooperation with China, the foreign
adviser noted that China is a major supplier of security equipment to Bangladesh
and a key partner in modernising Bangladesh's military.
Dhaka looks forward to further strengthening the cooperation, especially in the
military training programmes, he said.
He also said that enhanced defence cooperation could play a role in increasing
Bangladesh's involvement in the United Nations peacekeeping operations, which
remains a key priority for the country.
Touhid welcomed further cooperation in infrastructure development and energy
projects, particularly in green energy, emphasising the completion of projects on
time.
He emphasised technological cooperation, including in the ICT sector. The
development of Bangladesh's ICT sector with Chinese technological transfer
could be one of the main drivers of Bangladesh's economic growth in the coming
years.
The foreign adviser said Dhaka looks forward to seeing a more proactive role
from Beijing in the safe repatriation of the Rohingyas to Myanmar with their
rights, and security ensured.
""We appreciate China's cooperation, but unfortunately, the trilateral dialogue has
not yet succeeded in returning even one Rohingya (in the last seven years),"" he
said.
As Bangladesh and China approach the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic
relations, the foreign adviser expressed optimism about the future.
Bangladesh's political and economic trajectory will shape the direction of its
relationship with China, Touhid remarked.
He said the future of Bangladesh-China bilateral ties depends on various factors,
including regional and global political dynamics.
""We need meaningful cooperation from China, and new avenues of collaboration
must be explored by both sides,"" he said.
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen and Chair of the Committee on
White Paper on the State of Bangladesh's Economy Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya
were present as special guests.
Director of the Academic Advisory Council, SIIS Professor Dr Yang Jiemian, and
BISS Director General Major General Iftekhar Anis also delivered speeches in the
seminar presided over by BISS Chairman Ambassador AFM Gousal Azam Sarker.
The Chinese ambassador said Bangladesh has recently experienced significant
political transformations and is now at a critical historical juncture.
""As a comprehensive strategic cooperative partner, China firmly supports the
interim government in its endeavours for state reforms, maintaining law and
order, promoting economic development, and improving the livelihoods of the
people,"" he said.
Referring to his recent interactions with government officials, political parties,
and various sectors of society, the envoy said he witnessed firm commitment
from Bangladeshi people to China-Bangladesh friendship and their support for
developing bilateral relations.
""They believe that our two countries are now facing significant historical
opportunities for deeper cooperation,"" he said.
The ambassador said China supports Bangladesh in becoming a partner country
of the BRICS mechanism and a dialogue partner of ASEAN.
""China is willing to contribute to the repatriation of the Rohingyas and work
closely with Bangladesh on international and regional affairs, strengthening
coordination and cooperation within the United Nations and other multilateral
frameworks,"" he said.
Debapriya Bhattacharya urged Chinese companies to invest in Bangladesh's
Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone.
Such investments are essential for making the Karnaphuli Tunnel an
economically viable catalyst for enhanced economic cooperation between
Bangladesh and China.
The seminar had three working sessions, with the first titled ""The Impact of
Bangladesh's Changing Political Landscape on Regional Dynamics"" was
moderated by former Foreign Secretary Ambassador Farooq Sobhan.
The second working session titled ""Bangladesh's Political, Economic, and Social
Reforms and the Trends"" was moderated by Zhang Jiuan, associate research
fellow at the Academy of Contemporary China and World Studies.
Dhaka University's international relations Professor Amena Mohsin moderated

and Advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership"".
The speakers noted that Bangladesh-China cooperation has evolved in many ways
and economic ties are the cornerstone of the relationship.
They commended China's status as Bangladesh's largest trade partner and
highlighted several key initiatives undertaken by China to enhance Bangladesh's
export capabilities.",0.07013609,0.308440314,,Positive

'China-Bangladesh relations have
become the model of friendship between
countries with different social systems
and different cultures'
Thu Jul 19, 2012 12:00 AM
Last update on: Thu Jul 19, 2012 12:00 AM
His Excellency Li Jun
China's new ambassador to Bangladesh, Li Jun, arrived in Dhaka on February
18 and presented his credentials to the President on March 6. In an exclusive
interview with The Daily Star's Diplomatic Correspondent Rezaul Karim
recently, he talked on a wide range of bilateral issues. He said he would try his
best and cooperate with the government and people of Bangladesh to improve
further the ties between the two countries. He also said China and Bangladesh
are good neighbours. Since 1975, the bilateral relationship has always been
developing in a smooth manner an d bilateral cooperation in various areas has
been deepened. Following are excerpts from the interview.
The Daily Star (TDS): As the new Chinese Ambassador in Bangladesh, what are
the priorities you plan to emphasise during your assignment in this country?
Li Jun (L J): In March and June 2010, H.E. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of
Bangladesh, and H.E. Xi Jinping, Vice President of China, had a successful
exchange of visits. The two sides issued a Joint Statement and decided to establish
and develop a ""Closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation"" between China
and Bangladesh from the strategic perspective and on the basis of the principles
of longstanding friendship, equality and mutual benefit. I believe this set the
direction of and provided the guidelines for the development of our bilateral
relationship.
During my tenure,
* I will do my utmost to consolidate and develop the bilateral relationship with
the aim of promoting the development of our two countries and the welfare of
our two peoples;
* I will continue to push for more exchanges of high-level visits and contacts and
friendly exchanges between government agencies, parliaments, political parties,
and non-governmental organisations of our two countries;
* I will continue to push for intensified cooperation in trade, investment,
agriculture, transportation and infrastructure development on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit;
* I will continue to push for a further widening of people-to-people and cultural
exchanges and cooperation with a view to promoting mutual understanding and
friendship between the two peoples;
* I will continue to push for strengthened exchanges and cooperation between
the militaries and law enforcement departments to safeguard respective national
security and stability and promote peace and stability in the region;
* I will continue to push for closer coordination and cooperation to uphold the
common interests of the two countries as well as that of the developing countries
in international and regional affairs, such as climate change, energy and food
security.
I am confident that with the joint efforts of our two countries, the closer
comprehensive partnership of cooperation between China and Bangladesh will
be brought to a new high and bring tangible benefits for our two peoples.
TDS: Bangladesh and China enjoy excellent bilateral relations. How do you
foresee these relations developing further in the days ahead?
L J: The traditional friendship between our two peoples date back to over two
thousand years ago. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1975,
China-Bangladesh ties have been developing in a smooth manner and the
pragmatic cooperation in various fields has been further strengthened. It was the
efforts that successive governments and the peoples of our two countries have
made that contributed to the enhancement of China-Bangladesh friendship. To
them I pay my tributes.
Currently, the development of relations between China and Bangladesh enjoys the
right time, right place, and right people. China is implementing the 12th Five Year
Plan with scientific development as guidance and transforming economic growth
pattern as the main objective. At the same time, Bangladesh is pushing forward
the ""Digital Bangladesh"" and ""Vision 2012."" Our development strategies have
provided us great scope for cooperation. China and Bangladesh are close
neighbours, the region where we are situated has been experiencing rapid
growth, which created more opportunities for regional and international
cooperation. Apart from that, our bilateral relationship has neither problems left
from history, nor conflicts of interest at present. Compassion, understanding,
support, and mutual-assistance have always been the main theme of our
relationship.
I am convinced that the traditional friendship between China Bangladesh and
mutually beneficial cooperation will better contribute to the development of the
two countries and benefit the two peoples.
TDS: What are the major follow-up events after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
visit to China in March 2010?
L J: In March and June 2010, H.E. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh
and H.E. Xi Jinping, Vice President of China had an exchange of visits to each
other's countries. The two sides decided to establish a ""Closer Comprehensive
Partnership of Cooperation"" from the strategic perspective and on the basis of the
principles of longstanding friendship, equality, and mutual benefit. A Joint
Statement was also issued which reflected the consensus reached by leaders of
both countries to further consolidate and develop China-Bangladesh relationship.
Since then, there have been positive developments in bilateral relationship. There
have been constant exchanges of high-level visits between the two countries. The
Speaker of Bangladesh Parliament Abdul Hamid and Foreign Minister Dipu Moni,
as well as many ministers, have visited China. Liu Qi, Member of Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China (CPC) and Secretary of
CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, Qin Guangrong, Governor of Yunnan Province
of China as well as other high level officials visited Bangladesh.
There has been much progress in bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
Bilateral trade volume in 2011 reached $8.26 billion, with an increase of 17%
compared with 2010. Bangladeshi export to China reached $449 million, an
increase of 67.5%. According to local news reports, Chinese investment in
Bangladesh in 2011 amounted to over $200 million. The agreements on
introduction of 3G technology and expansion of 2.5G network, and on Shajhalal
fertilizer factory project were signed. The construction work will start very soon.
China also exempted debts of Bangladesh worth more than 600 million RMB.
There also have been positive developments in bilateral cultural exchanges. In
November 2011, Beijing Night Art Performance and Charming Beijing Photo
Exhibition were successfully held in Dhaka. Fantastic performances of the
Chinese artists and beautiful pictures of Beijing deepened Bangladeshi people's
understanding towards China. ""Happy Chinese New Year"" cultural events have
become a fam ous Chinese cultural brand in Bangladesh. Every year, Dhaka
citizens flock to the theater to enjoy the exciting moments of traditional Chinese
New Year.
In addition, there has been big progress also in other areas such as agriculture,
education, military, etc. I will continue to push forward the all-dimensional
cooperation in various fields between our two countries.
TDS: During the PM's visit to Beijing, Bangladesh and China agreed to
strengthen cooperation in the military and law enforcement areas at various
levels. Is there any progress in those fiends?
L J: Military cooperation is an important part of the all-dimensional cooperation
between China and Bangladesh. In the Joint Statement issued during Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to China in March 2010, the two sides agreed to
strengthen exchanges and cooperation between the militaries and law
enforcement departments to safeguard respective national security and stability
and promote peace and stability in the region. Military cooperation between
China and Bangladesh strictly adheres to relevant international law and norms on
international relations, and is not against any third party. In 2011, there was
successful cooperation between the two countries in this regard. Air Chief
Marshal Ma Xiaotian, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of People's Liberation
Army and Vice Admiral Ding Yiping, Deputy Commander of Navy of People's
Liberation Army visited Bangladesh with big success. General Mubin, Chief of
Army Staff of Bangladesh paid a visit to China, which was fruitful. I believe this
tendency of friendly cooperation will be maintained and further developed.
TDS: How do you evaluate China-Bangladesh relations under the present
Awami League-led grand alliance government in comparison to ties under
previous governments?
L J: The friendship between China and Bangladesh is a genuine and time-tested
one. No matter which party is in power, this bilateral relationship maintains the
tendency of moving forward. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in
1975, successive governments of Bangladesh have been making important
contributions to the development of the bilateral relationship. China-Bangladesh
relations have become the model of friendship between countries with different
social systems and different cultures.
During the tenure of current government under the leadership of H.E. Sheikh
Hasina, China-Bangladesh relations have witnessed considerable development,
and the all-dimensional cooperation between the two countries has been
continuously strengthened. Presently, China-Bangladesh relations are standing at
a new starting point, facing unprecedented historic opportunities. The Chinese
side stands ready to closely work with the Bangladesh side to further enrich the
closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation, strengthen the existing
bilateral cooperation in different fields, and enhance the friendship between the
two peoples.
TDS: Strategically, how does China see Bangladesh in the geo-political equation
in the region?
L J: China adheres to the foreign policy of ""building friendship and partnership
with the neighboring countries,"" and would like to establish and maintain good-
neighbourly relations with all its neighbouring countries. China attaches
importance to the important role of Bangladesh in maintaining peace, stability
and development of South Asia. China is willing to join hands with Bangladesh
and further promote the closer Comprehensive Cooperative Partnership between
the two countries.
TDS: The cabinet recently approved the draft of Sonadia Deep Seaport
Authority Act. Is there any development from the Chinese side about
construction of the deep seaport at Sonadia in Chittagong?
L J: The deep seaport in Sonadia Island is of strategic importance to Bangladesh
and will be helpful in enabling Bangladesh to become the regional transportation
and logistics centre. Chinese enterprises have advanced technologies,
equipments and ample funds. Over the years, China Harbour Engineering
Company Ltd has accumulated rich experience in this regard. Presently, this
company has established an office in Dhaka and stands ready to participate in
this project in a commercial manner. Chinese enterprises are also ready to
cooperate with enterprises from other countries to jointly take part in this
project. So long as the Bangladeshi side shows enough will and determination,
this project can make positive progress very soon.
TDS: How can China cooperate with Bangladesh in tackling the impact of
climate change in Bangladesh?
L J: As a country most vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh has been
experiencing sufferings caused by climate change. China fully understands and
respects the concerns of Bangladesh over it. During international negotiations on
climate change, China has always been supporting the legitimate and reasonable
requests of Bangladesh and the Least Developed Countries as a whole. As
developing countries, China and Bangladesh should stick to the principle of
""common but differentiated responsibilities"" and work together to safeguard the
common interests of developing countries.
China and Bangladesh are both victims of climate change. On this issue, the two
countries face the same challenges and our basic interests are the same. Over the
years, China has already carried out cooperation with Bangladesh in the area of
adaptation. For example, China helped Bangladesh in projects of river dredging.
The Chinese Government provided relevant training for Bangladeshi officials and
technicians. China will continue to strengthen the cooperation with Bangladesh
in this regard on the basis of ""equal consultation, mutual benefit and common
development"". China will continue to support the capacity building to help
Bangladesh better resist the adverse effects of climate change. Relevant
government institutions of the two countries can have detailed discussions.
TDS: Is there any progress in the construction of the 8th Friendship Bridge (2nd
Meghna Bridge) and Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Centre?
L J: Consultations are going on between our two countries concerning the 8th
Friendship Bridge. I believe there will be a positive result soon. As for the China-
Bangladesh Friendship Exhibition Centre, we noticed some news reports saying
that the Bangladeshi government has decided to build this Centre at Purbachal.
We would be very happy to get the confirmation from and work with the
Bangladeshi side so that concrete progress can be made concerning this project.
TDS: Would you be willing to provide assistance to Bangladesh in launching a
communication and remote sensing satellite into orbit in the near future?
L J: China is willing to provide assistance to Bangladesh in launching a satellite.
This has been reflected in the Joint Statement issued by the two countries during
the visit of Her Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to China in March
2010. The two sides can have further consultations in this regard.
TDS: Will you provide assistance for the dredging of riverbeds and for capacity
building through training of personnel?
L J: Bangladesh is a country with a large number of rivers. River dredging is
essential to the livelihood of Bangladesh people and the development of this
country. Against the backdrop of global climate change, river dredging becomes
even more important. China understands the need of Bangladesh and always tries
to extend its help. Each year, the Chinese government provides relevant training
courses for Bangladeshi government official and technicians. Besides, the
Chinese government strongly supports qualified Chinese enterprises to take part
in dredging projects. In September 2011, China Harbour Engineering Company
Ltd was selected to implement a project for Jamuna River dredging (14
kilometers). China will continue to provide its support at the request of
Bangladeshi government.",0.143263289,0.387477861,,Positive

Bangladesh needs a cohesive policy framework to harness BRI's potential fully and engage
in projects that align with national development goals, said a new report launched in

transformative and sustainable economic development, addressing challenges with
strategic planning and effective implementation,"" the report said.
The report titled ""The Belt and Road Initiative in Bangladesh: Achievements and Way
Forward"" in its executive summary laid emphasis on improving business environment with
upgradation of power, transportation, and logistics to attract private investments.

Advising Bangladesh not to join the QUAD, Chinese Ambassador to Dhaka Li Ji-ming said in
a virtual discussion with DCAB on May 10, 2021, ""Bangladesh's decision to join the anti-
China alliance will harm bilateral relations."" The United States-led alliance Quadrilateral
Security Dialogue known as QUAD includes India, Japan and Australia as its allies.
The Chinese ambassador further said, ""I know the QUAD was formed deliberating over
China. Japan has already made it very clear that it is taking part in this US-led allianceBN
25/05/2025, 14:19 Bangladesh and the issue of QUAD | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/bangladesh-and-the-issue-of-quad-1624645330 1/9because of China, and that is why China does not want to see Bangladesh in such an
alliance"". At the end of April 2021, Chinese Defense Minister General Wei Feng visited Dhaka.
He also said that China and Bangladesh should work together to ensure that no external
power could create hegemony in the region. China's relation with the region goes long
before its inception. Bangladesh's ongoing development work in collaboration with China
is much more than that of India, Japan, Australia and even the United States. China is our
main partner in the country's development but they do never waste their time talking
about the country's politics, nor they interfere in its internal affairs. China's foreign policy is
very transparent and neutral in this regard; they are our most effective and real friend with
economic development activities.
On the other hand, Bangladesh's foreign policy too is neutral and transparent. ""Friendship
with all"" in line with non-align policy is the significant feature of Bangladesh's foreign
policy; so, there is no feasibility to join any military alliance. As such, definitely Bangladesh
will not join the alliance against any country; so, there is no reason for China to be worried
about its policy, Bangladesh is always quite alert and careful in this regard. Bangladesh's
foreign policy is ""neutral and balanced"", and in the light of which Bangladesh takes every
decision.
Munshi Fayez Ahmed, the former ambassador of Bangladesh to China, has given a very
good explanation in this regard saying that no one from the four countries has publicly
called on Bangladesh to join the QUAD so far, though we do not know whether or not
clandestinely some parties tried to do that, there might be some efforts. But Bangladesh
did not show any inclination either. He added further that there might be some parties who
convinced Chinese ambassador that Bangladesh was considering to join the QUAD, based
on which he alerted Bangladesh. Since China is a tested and trusted friend of Bangladesh,
bearing Bangladesh's welfare in their mind, they advised Bangladesh in advance which
should be considered a good suggestion for it.
Furthermore, it is very clear that the alliance was formed to curb China's diplomatic,
political and economic influence, and subsequently it came up with an Indo-Pacific strategy
as not too many countries showed their interest in it. There is no bar for Bangladesh to join
Indo-Pacific strategy for its socio-economic development but it definitely will not it join any
military alliance.
All these we have to make understandable to China. In the meantime, no one should come
up with any negative comment against the statement of Chinese ambassador and, making
no fuss, Bangladesh should simply clarify its stand against the assumption of China.
There is a good reason for China to be worried about the QUAD which was formed to resist
China and their advancement, but Bangladesh will never join this alliance, as mentioned
earlier. So China, the good friend of Bangladesh, should not be worried at all.
China is always a well-wisher of Bangladesh; and is a big partner in every development
programme of ours. So, rationally it should be a well-thought decision of Chinese
government to prevent Bangladesh from joining the QUAD, otherwise the ambassador25/05/2025, 14:19 Bangladesh and the issue of QUAD | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/bangladesh-and-the-issue-of-quad-1624645330 2/9would not have spoken to advise Bangladesh in that tone. Chinese Defense Minister
General Wai Feng Yi had already informed the Bangladesh government about the issue
diplomatically during his visit to Dhaka, despite all these China still thinks that Bangladesh
is playing a positive role in the QUAD issue.
It is a general diplomatic norm that any issue has to be reported from one government to
the other which China has naively handled. It can be termed a political strategy that the
Chinese ambassador did to create political pressure; it is important for our political parties
to play a role in preventing Bangladesh from joining the QUAD. The pro-China political
parties have to come forward in this regard. It is not unusual for China to be concerned if
Bangladesh joins the QUAD which is an alliance of major powers in cooperation with India,
a US initiative to resist China, but the question is: why did the Chinese ambassador talk
about it? Usually the Chinese ambassador does not speak on his own. He speaks only when
it is approved from the highest level of administration or given the responsibility to speak.
So, it is clear that China is really concerned about the issue, and when it failed to resolve
the issue diplomatically, only then the ambassador made it public with the intention of
exerting political pressure. Socially, too, those of us who see the country benefiting from
China's cooperation should also think about it. In the meantime, our civil society as well
should play a positive role.
Moreover, over the past few years, China has been quite vocal on various issues, and has
been openly playing a role in many international issues; so, it has spoken directly about the
issue - and there is nothing wrong with that, for the sake of the country, we have to accept
things as easy.
Bangladesh can join both the alliances led by the United States and China for the economic
development of Bangladesh; we are currently joining the US-led Indo-Pacific Alliance, and
the Chinese-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization. As such Bangladesh does not want to
belong to any coalition - that is what it means. There is no room to think that we are under
the control of America or China, if we join some organizations led by them. So, there should
be no such reason for China to be concerned about Bangladesh joining the US-led Indo-
Pacific Alliance.
Over the past few years, Bangladesh has been playing a balanced role in foreign policy,
Bangladesh is always persistent for its own interest, various quarters and individuals have
long been advising Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on numerous issues but she is deliberately
doing what is needed for the prosperity of the country. The statement of the foreign
minister in this regard is quite striking. He said: ""we adhere to and maintain a neutral and
balanced foreign policy"".
The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD, also known as the QUAD) began in 2007 among
the leaders of the four countries, the United States, Japan, India, and Australia. To form this
alliance, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe initiated it first in 2007, and then he was
backed by US Vice President Dick Cheney, Australian Prime Minister John Howard and
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The type of alliance was ""Inter-Governmental25/05/2025, 14:19 Bangladesh and the issue of QUAD | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/bangladesh-and-the-issue-of-quad-1624645330 3/9Security Forum"". As China's economic and military strength continues to grow, so the
agenda of the four countries should be the one based on this.
The United States, India, Australia and Japan are currently closely monitoring the situation
and the perspective after the Chinese ambassador addressed Bangladesh. In a briefing on
May 12, 2021, US State Department spokesman Ned Price, answering a question, said: ""we
are monitoring the statement made by the Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh"". We
respect the sovereignty of Bangladesh and at the same time, we respect their right to make
decisions on its foreign policy by their own. Further he added that the United States had an
incredible relationship with Bangladesh, and the two countries were working on a wide
range of issues on a partnership basis, from economic growth to climate change. They
decided to form the QUAD in the Indo-Pacific region. The QUAD is a non-partisan but
important organization where the United States, India, Australia and Japan will work
together to form a free and open Indo-Pacific region of like-minded democracies.
Meanwhile, China has clarified its position with Bangladesh on whether to join the QUAD or
not. Recently, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Qinying said in a regular briefing
that Bangladesh-China relations had been built on the principle of peaceful coexistence.
Reiterating the good relations, she said: ""I want to make it clear that China and Bangladesh
are very close neighbours; we have built our relationship based on the five principles of
peaceful coexistence"".
China-Bangladesh relations are very strong, old, and resilient; as an economic comrade, we
have no alternative to China. It is China, which has challenged the United States as the
world's political and economic leader, it already has repeatedly explained why it opposes
the QUAD. So, for the sake of the continuation of the pace of development of Bangladesh, it
would be wrong in every way to join the QUAD.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Wen has said that despite the “steady progress” of Dhaka-Beijing
relations, some “disturbing noises” emerge once in a while.
But there is no use of that as the relationship is “widely endorsed by all walks of life across the
country,"" he said while speaking at the reunion of Bangladeshi participants attending 2023
Chinese government training programs at the embassy on Tuesday night.
The ambassador did not mention specifically what the “disturbing noises"" were, but he mentioned
the China trap issue, which is widely reported by Western media.
“The so-called China trap is sheer fabrication,” he said, adding that the projects carried out by
Beijing under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) would bring about “China benefit.""
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI.
China also comes into the political limelight in Bangladesh for criticizing Western interference in
the upcoming general elections.
The ambassador said China and Bangladesh are “not only traditionally friendly neighbours but
also strategic partners.""
In recent years, the exchanges between the two countries have been increasingly close, and
economic and trade cooperation has yielded fruitful results, setting an example of win-win
cooperation among developing countries, he said.Publish : 28 No v 2023, 11:58 PM

China is also a major source of foreign investment for Bangladesh, with an investment stock of
$3.17 billion and more diversified investment sectors being explored.
Currently, there are around 700 Chinese companies registered in Bangladesh; they have
constructed 7 railways, 12 roads, 21 bridges, and 31 power plants, providing 550,000 job
opportunities, he said.
""2023 is a fruitful year for the Chinese government's training programs in Bangladesh. With the
resumption of physical training programs, we have witnessed a remarkable increase in the
number of participants in China,"" he said, adding that 370 Bangladeshi officials have participated
in this year's training programs.
With that, he said, the Chinese government's training programs in Bangladesh have sent
approximately 5,500 Bangladeshi officials, technical experts, young scholars, and media
representatives to receive training in China, and all the seminars have received unanimous
acclaim.
""2023 is a year for further deepening the strategic partnership between China and Bangladesh.""
Echoed by no one but to no avail
The ambassador said China is the most reliable development partner and a true friend of
Bangladesh. It is a conclusion widely endorsed by all walks of life across the country.
""However, alongside the steady progress of China-Bangladesh relations, some disturbing noises
emerge once in a while.""
""China-Bangladesh cooperation finds its roots deep in the long-established friendship between
the two peoples. It would have been impossible without the political guidance of our respective
leaderships.
“The precious achievement is jointly made by contributors from various sectors and positions like
you and thus should be cherished by heart and maintained with care.
“The attempts to interfere with China-Bangladesh cooperation will be echoed by no one but to no
avail,” he said, adding that through actions they would showcase to the world “what true friends
and best partners really mean.""

greater number of Bangladeshi participants.
“Right now, there have been 50 flights flying between China and Bangladesh every week, and
nearly 10 thousand people commute to and from our two countries on a weekly basis.”
“More direct flights from Dhaka to Beijing will be opened very soon, so as to provide more
diverse flight options and make people-to-people exchanges even more convenient,” he said.
The ambassador said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has commended BRI for opening a new door
of development for Bangladesh.
“I firmly believe that this door not only carries mega projects to drive economic development but
also nurtures people-to-people exchanges and mutual learning between the two countries,” he
said.
“China is committed to ensuring those training programs are well-implemented and built into an
important platform for bilateral exchanges, thereby bringing the China-Bangladesh strategic
partnership of cooperation to a new level.”

'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and
geoeconomic conseq uences'
DhakaPublished: 20 Dec 2021, 14: 34
Among the many challenges and opportunities unfolding before Bangladesh, the Belt and
Road Initiative looms large. A modern reincarnation of the old Silk Route, this concept
initiated by China also raises concerns, both regionally and internationally. Bangladesh, a
signatory to BRI, has many considerations to factor in as this mega-plan takes shape,
evolves and morphs along the way.Staff Correspondent
'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences'
25/05/2025, 10:30 'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences'
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/roundtable/bri-is-a-mega-plan-with-deep-geostrategic-and-geoeconomic-consequences 1/4These were observations made at the roundtable, ‘Belt and Road Initiative: Connecting the
World’ held on Sunday at a hotel in the capital. Organised jointly by Dhaka Tribune and
Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS), this was a part of a series of
discussions arranged by the two institutions on matters of current national, regional and
international issues.
Going back to the outset, Major General (retd) ANM Muniruzzaman, president of BIPSS,
said that the BRI concept was first floated by the Chinese president Xi Jinping in 2013
while visiting Kazakhstan. President Xi Jinping elaborated this further the next year in
Jakarta. Now 142 countries, including Bangladesh, have signed on to BRI till date.
“The BRI is estimated to cost up to 4 trillion dollars,” Maj Gen (retd) Muniruzzaman
pointed out, terming it as “a mega project, a grand strategy that will have deep
geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences.” Explaining the magnitude of the initiative,
he said, “BRI is structured on six economic corridors, two being corridors with maritime
reach. Bangladesh is on one of the maritime corridors, the BCIM EC (Bangladesh, China,
India and Myanmar Economic Corridor).”
He said that BRI aims to fill the huge infrastructure gap in countries of Asia, including
Bangladesh, as infrastructure is fundamental to the region’s development goals.
Listing the concerns raised about BRI, the BIPSS president said these included possible
debt traps, environmental sustainability of the BRI projects, corruption linked to the
projects in several countries, strategic concerns and so on.
Editor of Dhaka Tribune Zafar Sobhan expressed his view that as Bangladesh had
established its place in the world, BRI had brought both challenges and opportunities to
the fore. He said that this initiative would assist in shaping the geopolitics of the region in
particular, and the world as a whole. Bangladesh, like each signatory of BRI, would have to
take up the initiative to suit its own interests and requirements. He pointed out the need
to discern the pros and cons of BRI and take decisions accordingly.
Speaking as a panelist at the event, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue
(CPD), Fahmida Khatun said that as an emerging economy and a member of BRI, it wasBRI is estimated to cost up to 4 trillion dollars, a mega project, a
grand strategy that will have deep geostrategic and geoeconomic
consequences

https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/roundtable/bri-is-a-mega-plan-with-deep-geostrategic-and-geoeconomic-consequences 2/4important to see why this initiative is important to Bangladesh.
As Bangladesh had transformed from a least development country to a developing one,
she pointed out, the country was investing hugely in infrastructure and required
resources. “At present there is a huge gap between what we need and what we get,” she
said, “So we need a flow of investment. In Bangladesh the largest BRI projects were in the
energy and transport sectors and so BRI was meeting the gap.”
Fahmida Khatun also raised several concerns about BRI, including environmental issues
and the use of coal in energy projects, coal being considered the dirtiest energy. Another
concern was the eviction of people from their homesteads to make way for roads and
railways. Even with compensation, people were reluctant to shift from their ancestral
lands. Transparency in the procurement process of many projects was also a matter of
concern.
Assistant professor of economics at East West University and a panelist at the event,
Parvez Karim Abbasi, highlighted the issues lesser discussed about BRI.
Why did BRI come about, he posed the question, explaining that it was about giving the
people an idea of a better tomorrow. Chinese president Xi Jinping had become a most
influential leader and the BRI vision enhanced his image. The confrontation with the West
served to raise his popularity further among his people.
Addressing the concern on debt dynamics, he said that the Chinese way of business was
different from the Western way of business. It had become the financier of last resorts and
spends 85 billion US dollars annually in this regard. There was a huge demand for
infrastructure and loans often became onerous. Chinese used a debt-driven model which
much of the loans being provided by its state-owned banks.
BRI had just emerged from infancy and was in its adolescence, so as to say, Parvez Karim
Abbasi observed.
The discussion was followed by questions, answers and comments by the audience
comprising foreign diplomats, present and former civil servants, retired military officers,
academics, members of the civil society, journalists and others.The Chinese way of business was different from the Western way of

“Implication of the Belt and Road Initiative for the Sustainable Development Goals in
Bangladesh” at BIISS auditorium.
Shamsul Alam, member (senior secretary) at the General Economic Division, Planning
Commission, attended the workshop as chief guest. 
“We have to construct a lot more of infrastructures to become a developed country. The BRI has
come to us as a boon in terms of economic growth and transformation,” he added.
The BRI has a targeted date of completion by 2049 on the occasion of China's centenary founding
anniversary. 
It projected that $120-500 billion investment would be required, which was 1.5% of the global
foreign direct investment (FDI). 
“The Middle East and North Africa have to invest 13%, East Asia Pacific 34%, Europe and
Central Asia 33% and South Asia 19% of the total projected investment,” Shamsul also said.
Mahfuz Kabir, research director of BIISS, said improving the country's infrastructures would help
Bangladesh attain its sustainable development goals (SDGs), as better connectivity could help
eradicate poverty and increase economic growth.
Ambassador M Fazlul Karim, chairman of BIISS, chaired the workshop.
Col Sheikh Masud Ahmed, acting director general, BIISS, delivered the welcome speech while

Bangladesh became member of BRI in 2016 following a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
This membership is aimed at attaining SDGs and achieving national development marks such as
becoming a middle-income country by 2021 and to emerge as a development nation by 2041.

A new chapter in Bangladesh-China relations
There are rivers, and then there are currents. The rivers of Bangladesh—Padma,
Meghna, Jamuna—run deep, shaping land, destiny and commerce. But currents,
the unseen forces that dictate the flow of history, are harder to chart.

How will Bangladesh-China relations shape up?
The tides of geopolitics, the undercurrents of trade wars, the ripples of power
shifts—all dictate the future of nations. In this interplay, Bangladesh and China
are not merely drifting neighbours; they are architects of a shared destiny, bound
by history, ambition and a blueprint for the future.
Recent events have added urgency to this discourse. A 21-member delegation, of
which I was a part, embarked on a journey to Beijing, not as idle emissaries but as
active negotiators of Bangladesh's place in the unfolding Asian century. In
meetings with high-ranking officials of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and
the foreign ministry, we presented a vision for an elevated partnership. The
response? Enthusiastic endorsement. 
What followed was not mere diplomatic pleasantries but a recognition:
Bangladesh is ready to be more than a recipient of Chinese investments; it is
ready to be a strategic collaborator, a manufacturing force, and a regional
stabiliser.
Bengal's entanglement with China predates modern geopolitics. In the fourth
century, Fa-hsien chronicled the culture of the Gangetic delta, and in the seventh
century, Hiuen Tsang met King Harshavardhana, bearing testimony to ancient
ties of scholarship and trade. Fifteenth century navigator Ma Huan, who sailed
under Admiral Zheng He, described Bengal's bustling ports, its Muslim rulers,
and the mercantile energy that linked it to the Chinese court. 
In matters of spirit, even the revered Shah Jalal of Sylhet found a place in Chinese
records, further cementing centuries-old exchanges. 
These were not just transactions; they were threads in a grander fabric, one that
today unfolds in the shape of economic corridors, industrial parks, and
transcontinental supply chains.
As China ascends to the heights of artificial intelligence and high-tech industries,
it leaves behind a vacancy—a space for manufacturing to migrate. Vietnam has
seized the opportunity. So has Indonesia. Why not Bangladesh?
DeepSeek, China's latest foray into AI, signals a shift, one where China will export
not just goods but knowledge while relocating its traditional industries
elsewhere. Bangladesh, with its labour force, its strategic location, and its
deepening ties through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), must make the case for
itself. The investments that were put on hold due to political uncertainties must
be rekindled, and Bangladesh should position itself as the next re-export hub for
Chinese goods, optimising trade routes, reducing costs, and sustaining China's
access to global markets. 
Of all the shadows looming over Bangladesh, none is darker than the crisis in
Myanmar. The Rohingya crisis is not just a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a
geopolitical fault line. Without stability in Myanmar, Bangladesh's security
remains fragile.
China's influence in Naypyidaw is undeniable. Yet, for too long, Bangladesh has
been a passive observer, waiting for Beijing to pressure the Myanmar junta into
action. The delegation pressed the case: China must do more. The repatriation of
the Rohingya, the stabilisation of Rakhine state, and the assurance that Myanmar
does not descend into prolonged chaos are matters that Beijing cannot afford to
ignore. The response? A willingness to engage, to mediate, and to ensure that the
next Bangladesh government finds a stable eastern frontier.
The world is in flux. The US, China and India form a triad of competing interests
in South Asia. Bangladesh's geography has placed it at the crossroads of this
rivalry, but geography is not destiny—policy is. Rather than picking sides,
Bangladesh can be a bridge between these global powers, leveraging its historical
closeness with India, its growing ties with China, and its strategic importance to
the US. 
This is not about neutrality but about active diplomacy—playing the role of
mediator, connector, and stabiliser in an increasingly multipolar world.
The meetings in China were not just about rhetoric. They were about plans,
commitments, and structured collaboration. The 11-point charter, adopted by the
delegation and welcomed by the CPC, outlines the next steps: strategic alignment
for regional stability; positioning Bangladesh in global trade shifts; strengthening
logistics and trade routes; advancing technological partnerships; expanding trade
and cultural exchange; building a sustainable industrial base; expanding military
manufacturing ties; leveraging China's diplomatic influence for Rohingya
repatriation; Teesta River water management; accelerating investment in
transport and communications; and developing banking and financial
collaboration.

W riting chapters of friendship between China and
Bangladesh
The enthusiasm from China's leadership was not just symbolic. These initiatives
are actionable, transformative, and most importantly, mutually beneficial.
The rivers in Bangladesh will always flow towards the sea, but the currents of
history can be steered. The Bangladesh-China relations have entered a new era,
one where Bangladesh is not just a recipient of investment but a co-creator of the
future. The foundation has been laid; the agreements have been acknowledged.
The challenge, now, is execution. Will Bangladesh rise to claim its place as a hub
of manufacturing, defence co-production, and geopolitical mediation? Or will it
allow others to dictate the terms of engagement? The moment demands action,
vision, and leadership.
The tide is rising. Bangladesh must set sail.

China rene ws its ʻBelt and Roadʼ push for global sway
Chinaʼs big-money push to build ports, rail lines and telecommunications networks around the world —
and increase Beijingʼs political sway in the process — seemed to be running out of gas just a year ago.

https://bdnews24.com/amp/story/economy%2Fchina-renews-its-belt-and-road-push-for-global-sway 1/11Now the program, called the Belt and Road Initiative, has come roaring back. W estern of ficials and
companies, for their part, are renewing their warnings that China’ s gains in business and political clout
could come at their expense.
Chinese companies signed Belt and Road contracts worth nearly $128 billion in the first 1 1 months of
last year , according to China’ s Commerce Ministry , a 41% increase over the same period in 2018. The
contracts are mostly for construction and equipment by big Chinese companies using Chinese skilled
labour and loans from Chinese banks, although the projects often create jobs for local labourers as well.
The latest contracts include a subway system for Belgrade, Serbia; an elevated rail line in Bogotá,
Colombia; and a telecommunications data centre near Nairobi, Kenya.FILE -- A construction project in Colombo, Sri Lanka, June 2, 2018.  Deals by Chinese

https://bdnews24.com/amp/story/economy%2Fchina-renews-its-belt-and-road-push-for-global-sway 2/11The return of Belt and Road is likely to raise tensions with the United States, which worries that China is
building a globe-spanning bloc of nations that will mostly buy Chinese goods and tilt toward China’ s
authoritarian political model. The initiative figures into many of the disputes between the two countries
over national security and technology .
The rush of new Belt and Road contracts follows a public pullback by Chinese of ficials in 2018 after
projects in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and elsewhere were criticised by local of ficials and others as
bloated and costly . China argues that since then, it has fine-tuned practices to trim waste.
“We will continue to follow a high-standard, people-centred and sustainable approach to promote high-
quality Belt and Road cooperation with partner countries,” Xi Jinping, China’ s top leader , said during a
visit to Brazil in November .

Chinese of ficials have long presented Belt and Road as a chance to give emerging markets the same
kind of world-class infrastructure that has helped make China a global economic powerhouse. Under
Belt and Road, state-owned Chinese banks typically lend practically all of the money for a construction
project to be carried out by Chinese companies. The borrowing countries are then required to repay the
money , often with oil or other natural resources.
Officials in the United States and W estern Europe have long criticised Belt and Road as predatory , and
in recent years, some of ficials in developing countries began to agree. In 2018, Sri Lanka gave its major
port to China after it could not repay loans, while Malaysia halted its own costly Belt and Road projects.
Chinese leaders began to acknowledge the criticism. V ice Premier Liu He of China publicly raised
concerns in early 2018 about heavy lending by Chinese banks, not just for the Belt and Road Initiative.
In the months that followed, Chinese financial regulators clamped down hard on domestic and overseas
lending alike. New Belt and Road contracts plummeted, Chinese data showed. China’ s financial
regulators told the country’ s banks to look twice at further lending to poor countries. Top leaders
practically stopped mentioning the program.Ad

https://bdnews24.com/amp/story/economy%2Fchina-renews-its-belt-and-road-push-for-global-sway 4/11But the credit crunch produced a much broader slowing in the Chinese economy in 2018 than expected.
Financial regulators reversed course. That has produced a revival of lending for domestic infrastructure
projects and for Belt and Road projects alike. Contracts started to be signed in earnest again in the final
weeks of 2018, and momentum built through last year .
In recent days, two groups representing W estern governments, companies and banks have raised
questions about the resurgence of the Belt and Road Initiative.
A report released Thursday morning by the European Chamber of Commerce in China concluded that
Chinese-built telecommunications networks and ports are set up in ways that make it hard for European
shipping companies, computer software providers and other businesses to compete.
A survey by the chamber of its members also found that they had been almost completely excluded from
bidding on Belt and Road Initiative contracts, which went mostly to Chinese state-owned enterprises.
“It was rather sobering to see that for businesses, it is quite insignificant what we get out of this,” said
Joerg W uttke, the chamber ’s president.
The Institute of International Finance, a research group in W ashington backed mainly by big W estern
banks, issued a dif ferent warning Monday as part of a broader report on global debt.
The institute’ s report said that many poor countries in the Belt and Road Initiative now find themselves
with sharply increased debt burdens. Many of these countries could barely qualify to borrow money even
before they took on the new debt, the report said.Ad

https://bdnews24.com/amp/story/economy%2Fchina-renews-its-belt-and-road-push-for-global-sway 5/11The institute’ s report also said that 85% of Belt and Road projects involved high emissions of
greenhouse gases linked to climate change. These projects have included at least 63 coal-fired power
plants.
The new reports come after a warning issued last year by European International Contractors, a trade
group of construction and engineering companies. The trade group cautioned that loans for Belt and
Road Initiative projects tend to carry considerably higher interest rates than those from lending
institutions like the W orld Bank.
The construction industry group, and also the European chamber , said that the costs of Belt and Road
Initiative projects are often greatly underestimated so that they can pass muster with Beijing of ficials.
Poor countries then end up paying for cost overruns, they said.
European business groups, which include telecommunications equipment makers, have focused lately
on Belt and Road’ s emphasis on telecommunications. Many developing countries now have national
telecom networks built by two Chinese companies, Huawei and ZTE, that have been big participants in
the Belt and Road Initiative. Huawei won a contract last spring to build a large telecom data centre in
Kenya.
The European chamber report said the networks were designed in ways that made it hard for European
companies to sell any further hardware or software in these markets. European markets for telecom
equipment, by contrast, are often more open, it argued. Huawei, for example, has sought to provide
equipment for Germany and Britain.
Alongside telecommunications, the biggest security concern in the W est about the Belt and Road
Initiative has involved China’ s construction or expansion of extensive ports. These ports now ring theAd

The European Chamber report said that European shipping companies, which have ranked among the
world’ s largest since the Middle Ages, increasingly find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. The
new ports are designed and managed by Chinese state-owned enterprises that are under the same
Chinese government agency as Chinese shipbuilders and Chinese shipping companies.
China has contended that economic growth has long suf fered in many emerging markets from high
transportation costs, and that the construction of new ports can reduce these costs.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/347578/bangladesh-not-ready-for-the-new-game-of 1/4Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, has said Bangladesh is
not ready to deal with the ""game of engagement"" in the future ""multiverse, multifocal and multi-
layered"" world.
Speaking at the unveiling of a book titled ""The Changing Nature of Geopolitics and the Futures
of Bangladesh,” he said Bangladesh has no enemy so far, but the future world will be ""fluid
multipolar,"" which will be difficult to deal with.
Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and former foreign
minister Dr AK Abdul Momen was present as the chief guest.
Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, also executive director of the Centre for Alternatives, edited the book.
He said the future will be a world which is ""multiverse, multifocal and multi-layered. Any
mathematical equation also will be very difficult.” 
""Are we ready for it? Is the curriculum allowing us to do that? That is the question. And I
definitely will say we are not ready for that,"" he said. 
""But the good part is that there are technologies which can help us. It is important to connect the
global world technologically. We should be connected with different countries of the world. 
""It is possible now, unless we do that, if we remain, you know, as we remained in the 19th or 20th
century, we cannot take the benefit of this particular century,"" he said.
He, however, said that Bangladesh is one country in the world which has no enemy, so far.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/347578/bangladesh-not-ready-for-the-new-game-of 2/4""And so it is a development without enmity. We are members of Saarc, Bimstec, BBIN, BCIM,
Indo-Pacific Alliance, BRI…name anything we are ready to see."" 
For that, he, however, credited the civilizational roots of Bangalis welcoming foreigners.
""This is the civilizational context of being a Bangali. Even now, we welcome outsiders like
anything. Some outsiders overstay. There is a problem. The British overstayed for 200 years,"" he
quipped, referring to the British rule in the subcontinent.
Former foreign minister Dr Momen while discussing the book said when “we are talking of trade
and other policies, one can look into the consumer or effective demand, domestic effective
demand and how to design policy packages so that the domestic effective demand continues to
grow, to give the economy a byproduct.”
He gave an example of the US and said the major income of the US comes from the domestic
market, the consumer market.
""The contribution of the US government to GDP is around 21% and private sector contribution is
around 70%, totalling 91%. So, 91% of GDP contribution, we say, comes from the consumer
market. So it is an economy that runs with its own people.”
Even in India, he said, 70% of GDP comes from the private sector and 14% from government
expenditure. “And in Bangladesh, the government sector is larger–it is 26% as per the estimates
here.”
Former state minister for foreign affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury and former principal officer of
the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen (Retd) Mahfuzur Rahman was also present at the event,
jointly organized by the Diplomats World magazine, FES Bangladesh and the Centre for
Alternatives.

macro-analysis constantly collides often with micro-level realities. Ultimately, the assumed
Chinese world leadership globalises Asia as much as it thickens regionalism (in anchors,
flows, and, well, his title: expectations), leaving it as vulnerably placated as it is fortified.
His Singapore colleague, Kishore Mahbubani, and he often depict the massive growth of
market-size across Asia, both absolutely and relatively. Mahbubani's poverty measurement
indicates that, in this century alone, more people than in the entire western hemisphere
population has moved into the consumption-driven middle-class: over 2 (two) billion. This,
in Khanna's estimates, will account for a whopping proportion of the $30 trillion middle-
class consumption expected by 2030, as against a tumbling $1 (one) trillion in western
countries. Led by, if not China anymore, then India, some of the highest economic growth-
rates have consistently been in Asia, with mouth-watering performances all along the Asian
rim-land: from Seoul and Tokyo in the east to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, with
Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Bangladesh, standing out in between.
China's BRI investments played a pivotal part. One flank crosses the Euro-Asian landmass
with enough detours to connect the major markets and spectacularly cross some massive
mountains. The $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, for example, connects
Gwador Port on the Arabian Sea with China's Southern Xinjiang Railway, snaking up the
Karakorum peaks and exposing the stunning Gilgit Valley landscape. Just as the Great Wall
became a wonder of the old world, this might be one for the post-modern world,
exemplifying other such claims, given the enormous BRI outreach, pocket, and vacuous
developmental opportunities.
Another flank, across the Indian Ocean, revolves around man-made islands, as in the South
China Sea, or brand new ports, either converting old ones for 21st Century usage, as in
Djibouti, or minting fresh ones, as in Hambantota. Yet, they highlight a growing debt-trap.
Multiplying transactions cannot obscure increasing China-dependence. It is too early for
even Khanna to estimate these costs, but with so many desperate countries outside Asia
scoping Asian opportunities, his Asian ""future"" may be riddled with as many pitfalls as
promises, not to mention generate too many external networks to make the geographically
giant ""Asia"" notion look smaller in the grander global-flow scheme. Pitfalls, like overzealous
BRI extractions, could recall the ostracised World Bank, though delivering the promises
without US market-accesses does not seem feasible. Vibrant Asian countries, from China,
India, and Japan, down to the second and third string countries, have long sought US
market destinations to change the game.
Developments of this kind have not gone unnoticed in the west, particularly in the very
country that has always courted Asia-based progress for over a century: the United States.
Its own Pacific interests merely extended its 19th century domestic ""westward movement""25/05/2025, 11:47 The future is Asian: Pragmatic predictions, persistent parasites | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/the-future-is-asian-pragmatic-predictions-persistent-parasites-1553182369 2/9across the North American landmass, and helped initiate both Asia's westernisation, as in
Japan after Commodore Perry's 1854 maiden visit, and low-wage migrant-flows that have
enormously helped US growth, beginning with the Chinese in the 1860s, then Japanese
from the 1890s, before the Filipinos, Indians, and Vietnamese, among others, entered. Fast-
forwarding to the BRI emergence today, the United States sought to connect all these dots,
militarily through the South East Treaty Organisation (SEATO) from 1954, economically
through, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) a decade later. The aborted
China corralling ""Asia Pivot"" and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) projects, down to the IPR
target today continue that fruitless streak.
Although Khanna projects fissures brewing within these Asian frameworks, such as the
competing infrastructural projects of India and Japan, secular developments, such as US
President Donald J. Trump's ""America First""-based tariffs against Asian countries, have
helped China, India, and Japan to coalesce, unexpectedly promoting, rather than dividing,
Asian stocks. Other secular developments could also have the exact opposite and more
splintering Asian consequences. A China-fearful Russia could, for instance, easily shift
preferences westwards.
Intra-Asian economic, and particularly trade growth may stand out as a 21st century
miracle the way Germany's and Japan's were after World War II. Yet, the same problems
persist: if it is not the demographic time-bomb (set to decimate the European productivity
and purchasing power) already engulfing Japan and, soon, China and South Korea too,
then identical nation-building conflicts that kept West Europe a constant battlefield until
World War II await in the wings. Many contested boundaries remain, as between India and
Pakistan, North and South Korea, or even the China-Russia flank around the Ussuri River.
How can China forget those 1969 skirmishes with the Soviet Union when it refuses to bury
the East China Sea hatchet with the same invading Japan from a century ago?
Shifting from territorial discussions, top-down governance in many Asian countries also
poses problems in an age conflagrated by a representative western counterpart.
Unpredictability haunts the air since many are not irreversibly democratic. Disruptions in
Malaysia and Thailand, populism in Pakistan and the Philippines, and truly repressive
regimes, as in Cambodia, North Korea, and the entire string of post-Soviet Union Central
Asian countries, impact day-to-day life, taxing the economy through military expenditures,
arms races, and thwarted innovative sparks.
Shifting from the political infrastructures to economic outcomes, many of these countries
may be clipping poverty, but without building the costly social safety networks to replace
traditional clan-based welfare functions. The faster their economic climb, the quicker those

and inefficiencies.
Be these as they may, the BRI payback terms may become the straw to break the camel's
back. Much has been written on this, even in this newspaper, for example, the debt-burden
of Pakistan and Sri Lanka over Gwador and Hambantota port-construction, and with 99-
year land-leases to mollify the Chinese turning into export processing zones, Chinese arm-
twisting may even surpass the World Bank's while deepening economic Chinese
dependency. Such an unsustainable transactional atmosphere threatens the most durable
foundations of all: each country's infrastructures.
Rising economic costs revives the very plague hitting the United States so hard that the
Trump presidency has even contemplated retreating into isolation. His ""America First"" may
be rhetorical, but the military-led IPR proposal may be the wrong approach to the wrong
problem at the wrong time. Learning SEATO lessons rather than fishing in the dark could
help.
Both authors capture the growing Asian dominance. Yet, elevating it as the century's only
clarion call does not do justice to historical patterns, instinctual policy-making fickleness,
and the numerous local tensions one cannot simply gloss over no matter how broad a
brushstroke China, India, or Japan may be making. The future will be Asian, but also
spotted, as before.

'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and
geoeconomic conseq uences'
DhakaPublished: 20 Dec 2021, 14: 34
Among the many challenges and opportunities unfolding before Bangladesh, the Belt and
Road Initiative looms large. A modern reincarnation of the old Silk Route, this concept
initiated by China also raises concerns, both regionally and internationally. Bangladesh, a
signatory to BRI, has many considerations to factor in as this mega-plan takes shape,
evolves and morphs along the way.Staff Correspondent
'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences'
25/05/2025, 10:30 'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences'
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/roundtable/bri-is-a-mega-plan-with-deep-geostrategic-and-geoeconomic-consequences 1/4These were observations made at the roundtable, ‘Belt and Road Initiative: Connecting the
World’ held on Sunday at a hotel in the capital. Organised jointly by Dhaka Tribune and
Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS), this was a part of a series of
discussions arranged by the two institutions on matters of current national, regional and
international issues.
Going back to the outset, Major General (retd) ANM Muniruzzaman, president of BIPSS,
said that the BRI concept was first floated by the Chinese president Xi Jinping in 2013
while visiting Kazakhstan. President Xi Jinping elaborated this further the next year in
Jakarta. Now 142 countries, including Bangladesh, have signed on to BRI till date.
“The BRI is estimated to cost up to 4 trillion dollars,” Maj Gen (retd) Muniruzzaman
pointed out, terming it as “a mega project, a grand strategy that will have deep
geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences.” Explaining the magnitude of the initiative,
he said, “BRI is structured on six economic corridors, two being corridors with maritime
reach. Bangladesh is on one of the maritime corridors, the BCIM EC (Bangladesh, China,
India and Myanmar Economic Corridor).”
He said that BRI aims to fill the huge infrastructure gap in countries of Asia, including
Bangladesh, as infrastructure is fundamental to the region’s development goals.
Listing the concerns raised about BRI, the BIPSS president said these included possible
debt traps, environmental sustainability of the BRI projects, corruption linked to the
projects in several countries, strategic concerns and so on.
Editor of Dhaka Tribune Zafar Sobhan expressed his view that as Bangladesh had
established its place in the world, BRI had brought both challenges and opportunities to
the fore. He said that this initiative would assist in shaping the geopolitics of the region in
particular, and the world as a whole. Bangladesh, like each signatory of BRI, would have to
take up the initiative to suit its own interests and requirements. He pointed out the need
to discern the pros and cons of BRI and take decisions accordingly.
Speaking as a panelist at the event, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue
(CPD), Fahmida Khatun said that as an emerging economy and a member of BRI, it wasBRI is estimated to cost up to 4 trillion dollars, a mega project, a
grand strategy that will have deep geostrategic and geoeconomic
consequences
Maj Gen (retd( Muniruzzaman, president, BIPSS25/05/2025, 10:30 'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences'
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/roundtable/bri-is-a-mega-plan-with-deep-geostrategic-and-geoeconomic-consequences 2/4important to see why this initiative is important to Bangladesh.
As Bangladesh had transformed from a least development country to a developing one,
she pointed out, the country was investing hugely in infrastructure and required
resources. “At present there is a huge gap between what we need and what we get,” she
said, “So we need a flow of investment. In Bangladesh the largest BRI projects were in the
energy and transport sectors and so BRI was meeting the gap.”
Fahmida Khatun also raised several concerns about BRI, including environmental issues
and the use of coal in energy projects, coal being considered the dirtiest energy. Another
concern was the eviction of people from their homesteads to make way for roads and
railways. Even with compensation, people were reluctant to shift from their ancestral
lands. Transparency in the procurement process of many projects was also a matter of
concern.
Assistant professor of economics at East West University and a panelist at the event,
Parvez Karim Abbasi, highlighted the issues lesser discussed about BRI.
Why did BRI come about, he posed the question, explaining that it was about giving the
people an idea of a better tomorrow. Chinese president Xi Jinping had become a most
influential leader and the BRI vision enhanced his image. The confrontation with the West
served to raise his popularity further among his people.
Addressing the concern on debt dynamics, he said that the Chinese way of business was
different from the Western way of business. It had become the financier of last resorts and
spends 85 billion US dollars annually in this regard. There was a huge demand for
infrastructure and loans often became onerous. Chinese used a debt-driven model which
much of the loans being provided by its state-owned banks.
BRI had just emerged from infancy and was in its adolescence, so as to say, Parvez Karim
Abbasi observed.
The discussion was followed by questions, answers and comments by the audience
comprising foreign diplomats, present and former civil servants, retired military officers,
academics, members of the civil society, journalists and others.The Chinese way of business was different from the Western way of

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/347578/bangladesh-not-ready-for-the-new-game-of 1/4Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, has said Bangladesh is
not ready to deal with the ""game of engagement"" in the future ""multiverse, multifocal and multi-
layered"" world.
Speaking at the unveiling of a book titled ""The Changing Nature of Geopolitics and the Futures
of Bangladesh,” he said Bangladesh has no enemy so far, but the future world will be ""fluid
multipolar,"" which will be difficult to deal with.
Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and former foreign
minister Dr AK Abdul Momen was present as the chief guest.
Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, also executive director of the Centre for Alternatives, edited the book.
He said the future will be a world which is ""multiverse, multifocal and multi-layered. Any
mathematical equation also will be very difficult.” 
""Are we ready for it? Is the curriculum allowing us to do that? That is the question. And I
definitely will say we are not ready for that,"" he said. 
""But the good part is that there are technologies which can help us. It is important to connect the
global world technologically. We should be connected with different countries of the world. 
""It is possible now, unless we do that, if we remain, you know, as we remained in the 19th or 20th
century, we cannot take the benefit of this particular century,"" he said.
He, however, said that Bangladesh is one country in the world which has no enemy, so far.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/347578/bangladesh-not-ready-for-the-new-game-of 2/4""And so it is a development without enmity. We are members of Saarc, Bimstec, BBIN, BCIM,
Indo-Pacific Alliance, BRI…name anything we are ready to see."" 
For that, he, however, credited the civilizational roots of Bangalis welcoming foreigners.
""This is the civilizational context of being a Bangali. Even now, we welcome outsiders like
anything. Some outsiders overstay. There is a problem. The British overstayed for 200 years,"" he
quipped, referring to the British rule in the subcontinent.
Former foreign minister Dr Momen while discussing the book said when “we are talking of trade
and other policies, one can look into the consumer or effective demand, domestic effective
demand and how to design policy packages so that the domestic effective demand continues to
grow, to give the economy a byproduct.”
He gave an example of the US and said the major income of the US comes from the domestic
market, the consumer market.
""The contribution of the US government to GDP is around 21% and private sector contribution is
around 70%, totalling 91%. So, 91% of GDP contribution, we say, comes from the consumer
market. So it is an economy that runs with its own people.”
Even in India, he said, 70% of GDP comes from the private sector and 14% from government
expenditure. “And in Bangladesh, the government sector is larger–it is 26% as per the estimates
here.”
Former state minister for foreign affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury and former principal officer of
the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen (Retd) Mahfuzur Rahman was also present at the event,
jointly organized by the Diplomats World magazine, FES Bangladesh and the Centre for
Alternatives.

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/china-bangladesh-to-deepen-ties 1/8Chinese Executive Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang met Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor
Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference in the
coastal Chinese town and the two leaders also led a bilateral meeting.
""President Xi Jinping attaches tremendous importance to your visit,"" Vice-Premier Ding
said, adding that China hopes Bangladesh would prosper and grow under the leadership of
Prof Yunus. 
During the meeting, the Bangladesh Chief Adviser reiterated the country's firm
commitment to the One-China policy. Dhaka takes pride to be the first South Asian country
to join China's Belt and Road Initiative, he said.
Dhaka sought Chinese support to development and livelihood projects and also called for
reduction of interest rates for Chinese loans from 3 percent to one or two percent for
Bangladesh. 
It also sought a waiver of commitment fees on the Chinese-funded projects in Bangladesh.
The Chief Adviser also sought Beijing's help in facilitating the relocation of the Chinese
manufacturing industries, including ready-made garments, electric vehicles, light
machinery, high-tech electronics, chip manufacturing and the solar panel industry.
Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang said Beijing will extend duty-free and quota-free access to
Bangladeshi goods to China until 2028 – two years after Dhakaʼs graduation from a LDC to a
middle-income economy.
Beijing is also keen to start free trade negotiations with Dhaka, he said.
Chinese Executive Vice-Premier said his country would fund modernisation efforts of the
Mongla Port and the Dasherkandi Sewage project.
The Vice Premier said China last year signed a protocol to import mango from Bangladesh. 
Bangladesh's mango export to China would begin this summer. Beijing would also import
jackfruit and guava and other aquatic products from Bangladesh as China attempted to
minimize huge trade imbalance, he said.
He said the Chinese government and its universities would grant more scholarships to
Bangladeshi students.  Several thousand Bangladeshi students are already studying in
Chinese universities.25/05/2025, 14:25 China and Bangladesh to deepen ties | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/china-bangladesh-to-deepen-ties 2/8The Vice Premier assured Chinese funding for purchasing four ocean going vessels for
Bangladesh Shipping Corporation. 
He said Beijing would foster dialogue between Bangladesh and Myanmar in an effort to
resolve the Rohingya crisis.
Prof Yunus thanked the Chinese leadership for their support, saying Thursday's meeting
marks another milestone in the ever-deepening Bangladesh-China partnership.
""Let us resolve to work together to usher in a new era of friendship, cooperation and
collaboration, reinforcing the strategic ties between our two nations,"" he said.
Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain, Energy, Rail and Road Transport Adviser Fouzul Kabir
Khan, High Representative to the Chief Adviser Dr Khalilur Rahman and BIDA Executive
Chairman Ashiq Chowdhury were present during the meeting.

Describing China as a very important development partner, Foreign Minister
Hasan Mahmud yesterday said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's forthcoming
China visit will be a very important one, which will involve discussion on many
File photo of Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud
development projects.
""Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will go to China on July 8. The visit will be from
July 8 to 11,"" Hasan confirmed the dates.
Hasina is going to China after coming back from India.
""It is a reflection that we have been maintaining a balanced diplomacy,"" he told
reporters while responding to a question at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The minister said Dhaka follows Bangladesh foreign policy's doctrine:
""Friendship to all, malice towards none,"" which was formulated by Father of the
Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
He said the premier was the first head of government invited by Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi after forming the new Indian government.
""It is indeed a matter of honor for us,"" said Hasan.
""India is our true friend and the relationship with India is based on the spirit of
the 1971 Liberation War and bonded through cooperation and this special
relationship is never to be broken.""
On the other hand, Hasan said, China is Bangladesh's important development
partner as Beijing had made significant investments in the country's various
projects, he added.
""Many Chinese companies are engaged in Bangladesh's Padma Bridge project,
Bangabandhu Tunnel and several railway projects as well,"" he said.
""I believe the friendly relations between two countries [Bangladesh and China]
will be strengthened through the [upcoming] visit of the prime Minister [Hasina]
to China,"" he said.
Responding to a query over the discussion agendas of the upcoming prime
minister level bilateral meeting in Beijing, he said they are still developing those
as there is more than one week to go before the visit.
The foreign minister said the Rohingya issue will get priority in Beijing as China's
role is crucial in commencing the repatriation of the forcibly displaced people
from Bangladesh to Myanmar.
Responding to questions on both Chinese and Indian interest regarding the
Teesta river project, Hasan said, ""As Teesta is a transboundary river of India and
Bangladesh, we think it will be good for us if India helps us [on Teesta project] as
per our requirement.""",0.17028355,0.452532468,,Positive
Bangladesh as a Potential Destination for Chinese Firms _ Tapping into China’s industrial relocation_ A golden opportunity for Bangladesh_ (1).pdf,"Tapping into China’s industrial relocation
Geopolitical Insights
A golden opportunity for Bangladesh?
Wed Feb 5, 2025 09:00 AM
Last update on: Thu Feb 6, 2025 01:14 AM
Over the last four decades, China has established itself as the leading hub for
manufacturing on a global scale. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the
implementation of economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping facilitated the entry
of foreign direct investment (FDI) in China's economy, prompting numerous
companies to shift their manufacturing operations to the country. Nonetheless,
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi tells Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus that China wants to invest in the production of
solar panels in Bangladesh, on September 25, 2024. PHOTO: CA OFFICE
the persistent difficulties faced by the world's second largest economy, including
geopolitical tensions with the United States, environmental regulations and
overcapacity in manufacturing have led China to relocate various industries to
friendly nations in Southeast Asia, South Asia and Central Asia. It's pertinent to
analyse China's industrial relocation and how Bangladesh can benefit from it.
Why are Chinese industries relocating?
First, China is undergoing a significant transformation, influenced by a variety of
economic, geopolitical, environmental and policy issues. This transition is
driving Chinese companies, especially in low-end manufacturing, to explore
alternative regions that provide improved market access with greater outputs.
China has been experiencing an upsurge in production wages and production
costs in recent times, which has led to a decline in the cost competitiveness, once
considered to be the strength of Chinese economy. Furthermore, stringent
environmental regulations have led to a shift in compliance expenses that's
influencing rendering domestic industry to other regions. Last year, Chinese
Premier Li Qiang outlined the yearly economic growth target of five percent
during his inaugural working report at the National People's Congress. He
emphasised the need for a significant advancement through the acceleration of
industry modernisation and the ""development of new quality productive forces.""
The approach that Li Qiang spoke of entails a systematic transition towards high-
end, smart and clean manufacturing sectors, with a strategic relocation of several
domestic industries to emerging economies in their geographical proximity. In
the context of emerging economies, Bangladesh presents itself as a suitable
region for attracting these shifting industries.

How Trump's economic policies will impact South Asia
Additionally, the ongoing tensions in US-China trade and broader decoupling
trends are prompting Chinese firms to adopt a ""China Plus One"" strategy aimed at
diversifying their production bases to mitigate geopolitical risks. Southeast and
South Asia have emerged as significant relocation centres in response to rising
tariffs and intensified trade barriers between China and Western countries.
Chinese firms recognise that the developing nations in South and Southeast Asia
possess adaptable tariff regulations when engaging with the US and Western
markets. In the same scenario, Chinese FDI in Mexico reached a 13-year high in
2023, with capital expenditure surging to $5.6 billion, up significantly from $267
million in 2018. This ""near-shoring"" move was intended to exploit benefits of
exporting goods to the US produced in Mexico under the USMCA agreement.
Moreover, in the context of China's recent five-year plans, it is evident that the
country is strategically shifting its focus from its previous role as the ""world's
factory,"" which was characterised by the production of low-cost, low-tech goods
supported by competitive labour costs and supply chain efficiencies. China's new
industrial policy of ""Made in China 2025"" aims to enhance the manufacturing
capabilities of Chinese industries, transitioning from labour-intensive operations
to a more technology-driven, sophisticated industrial hub. The focus on high-tech
productive forces, including electric vehicles (EVs), artificial intelligence (AI), and
cutting-edge semiconductors, is expediting the relocation as well.
Bangladesh as a potential destination
Bangladesh has always been a viable destination for Chinese firms as it offers
some significant benefits that Chinese companies enjoy at home. Till date,
Bangladesh can offer the most competitive wages compared to other viable
destinations in the region. The average monthly wage of an industrial worker still
remains below $150 that makes it lucrative for manufacturing industries.
Additionally, the young labour force in Bangladesh presents a significant long-
term benefit for industrial production. The country boasts a demographic
dividend where more than 65 percent of its population is under 35 years old.
Moreover, the geographical location of Bangladesh in the crossroad of the Indo-
Pacific region makes it a suitable transportation and logistical hub for
international shipping of produced goods. As of present circumstances,
Bangladesh can offer duty-free access to European markets as well with zero
tariffs on EBA (Everything but Arms) scheme and curtailed tariffs on goods
exported to the US, Japan, Australia and other countries. Bangladesh also offers
dedicated Export Processing Zones (EPZs) and Special Economic Zones (SEZs) for
attracting FDI, especially in the coastal region.
Chinese industries relocating matter for Bangladesh
The Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) has established a structured
timeline aimed at operationalising five economic zones within the next two years,
out of a total of 100 proposed zones all over Bangladesh. These zones are vital for
attracting FDI from Chinese firms aiming to relocate their operations. It is
noteworthy that China holds the second position after Bangladesh; 108
companies have invested in EPZs. According to data from the Bangladesh Bank,
FDI inflows reached $1.46 billion in FY2023-24, with $424 million of this total
attributed to investments in the export processing zones. Ashraful Kabir, who
serves as a member for investment promotion at BEZA, highlighted that in
addition to RMG products and accessories, 48 percent of the products
manufactured in the EPZs have now diversified into other categories. He noted
that decreasing dependency on RMG production allows the EPZs to enhance
Bangladesh's economic stability by promoting product diversification and
expanding export opportunities. Chinese firms invested $283 million in FY2023-
24, and China is the third largest FDI source for Bangladesh that stands with $1.56
billion in total as of June 2024.

before?
It is worth noting that the growth in the manufacturing sector has been sluggish
compared to the service sector. In 2013, the number of economic units of the
industrial sector was 9.2 million, which increased to 1.04 million in 2024. The
growth rate has increased by 15.38 percent in a decade. The slow rate of pace in
Bangladesh's economy does not end here; the number of unemployed people in
the country has increased to 2.66 million, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics (BBS) for the period of July-September 2024. Bangladesh must feel the
urge to attract Chinese industries to invest and increase FDI to overcome this
stagnation. The head of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) International
Department, Liu Jianchau, said to Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Adviser M Touhid
Hossain during his recent visit that China is thinking of relocating its industries
and they are considering Bangladesh as an option. They also think that exporting
the manufactured goods to other countries from Bangladesh and the matter of
incentives in exports will be beneficial to China.
Challenges ahead
However, the existing infrastructure presents significant challenges with shortage
of energy and port delays contributing to increased expenses and diminished
investor trust. The government has initiated large-scale EEZs; however, the pace
of project implementation is not satisfactory. It is an undeniable fact that
Bangladesh has administrative inefficiency and bureaucratic complexities in
attracting foreign investment, which introduces an additional layer of complexity.
Policy reforms are needed now to attract Chinese investment despite advantages.
Tax concessions, tax holiday, and ease of doing business should be prioritised to
attract relocating industries. Bangladesh has a shortage of skilled labour force to
propel newly relocated industries. It will continue to be a significant area of
concern if no comprehensive action plan from the government is taken.
Foreign investors endure significant challenges in Bangladesh due to intricate,
often bureaucratic, approval procedures from various government agencies that
must be fixed to harness relocating Chinese industries. Regional competitors like
Vietnam and Indonesia have already streamlined their investment frameworks to
facilitate the relocation of Chinese industries. Should Bangladesh not implement
necessary reforms to its regulatory framework and expedite investment
processes, it may face significant challenges in maintaining its competitive edge
in international trade.

Bangladesh needs  China for its rapid industrialisation: Shahriar Alam

Former State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam on Wednesday said Bangladesh
needs China for its rapid industrialisation and noted the significant role that China has
played over the last 15 years.
“Industrialised Bangladesh needs China,” he said, noting that Bangladesh-China relations
have been deepened over the last decade, reports UNB.
Delivering his opening remarks at a roundtable discussion, Shahriar recalled the historical
facts during the Liberation War but recognised Chinaʼs contributions over the last one and a
half decades.
The lawmaker said there is no reason to compare Bangladeshʼs relations with India and
China. Shahriar remembered the historic role of India and shared sacrifice during the
Liberation War in 1971.
He expressed displeasure over the propaganda centering on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinaʼs
recent State visit to India.
Bangladesh Foundation for Regional Studies (BFRS) hosted the discussion moderated by
PMʼs former Special Assistant Barrister Shah Ali Farhad.

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/bangladesh-needs-china-for-its-rapid-industrialization-shahriar-alam 1/5Alam, Prof Rumana Islam, DCAB President Nurul Islam Hasib, former DCAB President
Raheed Ejaz, among others, were present.
There are new avenues that have been opened which came up for discussion including
export diversification and a possible free trade agreement (FTA).
BIISS Research Director Dr Mahfuz Kabir presented a paper at the beginning of the
discussion.
Although Bangladesh-China diplomatic relations were established officially in January
1976, bilateral relations reached a new height since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took
office for the second term in January 2009, according to a concept note.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinaʼs visits to China in 2010 and 2014 laid the foundation for the
current warm relations between the two countries, it said.
Chinese President Xi Jinpingʼs historic visit to Bangladesh in 2016 elevated the relations
between the two countries to a “strategic partnership of cooperation”.
During the said visit, the two countries signed 21 agreements worth around US$ 40 billion.
China has become a dependable partner of Bangladesh in terms of infrastructure
development, having collaborated on such major projects as the Padma Bridge, the
Karnaphuli River Underwater Tunnel, etc. So far, China has helped Bangladesh build 21
bridges, 11 highways covering 550 km of roads, and 27 energy and power projects, with
numerous more projects in the development and/or planning stages.
Trade too is flourishing between the two countries. China implemented duty-free facilities
on 97% of Bangladeshi products on 1 July 2020. Later, it was increased to 98%.
In the 2022-23 fiscal year, China was Bangladeshʼs single largest trading partner, with
bilateral trade amounting to US$ 24 billion, of which Bangladeshʼs exports amounted to
US$ 677 million and imports amounted to US$ 22.9 billion.
Minister of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee Liu Jianchao,
during his recent visit to Dhaka, expressed optimism that the forthcoming visit of Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina to China would be a very fruitful one.
“I think that the forthcoming visit by the Prime Minister is going to be a very fruitful one,” he
told reporters after his meeting with Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud.
“So we do have a lots of expectations, and I am sure that our two governments and
government agencies will work out a general plan for the cooperation between our two
countries in time to come,” said the Chinese minister.
He said they had a very in-depth and comprehensive discussion on bilateral relations, the
history of the relationship, and friendship.
“Thus, the friendship was cemented throughout these years, nearly fifty years after …since
our bilateral relation was established in 1975,” Jianchao said.
He said China shares the interest and also the very strong inspiration, and enthusiasm in
working with Bangladesh in its drive for prosperity, for example, the Vision-2041 and also
the goal to achieve a Smart Bangladesh.
“China remains a brand as a neighbour and a partner for your modernisation drives. So, we
will do it within the framework of Belt and Road Initiative,” he added.

Welcoming the China's offer, the agriculture minister said the Bangladesh government will
provide all kinds of assistance.
The minister also requested the ambassador to provide more scholarships in the field of higher
education for Bangladeshi scientists.
He said Bangladesh wants to maintain good relations with all countries keeping the national
interest first.
“Bangladesh-China relations are very important for economic development and peace and
stability in the region. There are many opportunities to boost cooperation in the field of
agriculture between Bangladesh and China,” Razzaque said adding: “Cooperation in the
agriculture sector will take Sino-Bangladesh bilateral relations to new heights.”
The agriculture minister also asked for China's support to help repatriate the Rohingya people.
""Bangladesh is a small country with a population of 170 million. In such a situation, it is very
difficult to ensure food, shelter, medical, and security for one million Rohingyas. Moreover,
Rohingyas are also a threat to the security of the country,” he said.
In response, the Chinese ambassador said: “China is working sincerely to find a permanent
solution to the Rohingya problem.”

""This year marks the golden jubilee of diplomatic relations between Bangladesh
and China.
The adviser's visit to China is therefore of significant importance,"" said
spokesperson Mohammad Rafiqul Alam during a weekly media briefing at the
foreign ministry yesterday.
The foreign adviser is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi in Beijing on January 21.
Additionally, official sources have indicated that Touhid will also engage with
senior officials of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and is likely to visit
Shanghai as part of the trip.
During the bilateral meetings, key issues such as agriculture, education, trade,

Highlighting the economic aspect of the visit, Alam noted that trade between
Bangladesh and China currently stands at USD 25 billion, though the balance
heavily favours China.
""The adviser's trip aims to address trade imbalances and explore avenues for
increased Chinese investment in Bangladesh,"" he said, adding that the full agenda
for the visit is still being finalised.
Alam said the relationship between Bangladesh and China has evolved into a
""Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership,"" reflecting its multifaceted
nature.
""This upcoming visit, as the first bilateral trip by the adviser following the
formation of Bangladesh's interim government in August, presents a valuable
opportunity to further strengthen and deepen the bilateral ties between the two
nations,"" said the spokesperson.
Bangladesh and China are set to celebrate the golden jubilee of their diplomatic
relations in 2025, and both countries have undertaken various programs to mark
the milestone.
""The visit will also provide an opportunity to outline the future roadmap for
Bangladesh-China bilateral relations, focusing on enhancing economic
cooperation, expanding trade and investment, and reviewing progress in ongoing
collaborations,"" he added.
The foreign adviser is also expected to deliver speeches at the ""China Institute of
International Studies"" and the ""Shanghai Institute of International Studies""

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/347578/bangladesh-not-ready-for-the-new-game-of 1/4Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, has said Bangladesh is
not ready to deal with the ""game of engagement"" in the future ""multiverse, multifocal and multi-
layered"" world.
Speaking at the unveiling of a book titled ""The Changing Nature of Geopolitics and the Futures
of Bangladesh,” he said Bangladesh has no enemy so far, but the future world will be ""fluid
multipolar,"" which will be difficult to deal with.
Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and former foreign
minister Dr AK Abdul Momen was present as the chief guest.
Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, also executive director of the Centre for Alternatives, edited the book.
He said the future will be a world which is ""multiverse, multifocal and multi-layered. Any
mathematical equation also will be very difficult.” 
""Are we ready for it? Is the curriculum allowing us to do that? That is the question. And I
definitely will say we are not ready for that,"" he said. 
""But the good part is that there are technologies which can help us. It is important to connect the
global world technologically. We should be connected with different countries of the world. 
""It is possible now, unless we do that, if we remain, you know, as we remained in the 19th or 20th
century, we cannot take the benefit of this particular century,"" he said.
He, however, said that Bangladesh is one country in the world which has no enemy, so far.

Indo-Pacific Alliance, BRI…name anything we are ready to see."" 
For that, he, however, credited the civilizational roots of Bangalis welcoming foreigners.
""This is the civilizational context of being a Bangali. Even now, we welcome outsiders like
anything. Some outsiders overstay. There is a problem. The British overstayed for 200 years,"" he
quipped, referring to the British rule in the subcontinent.
Former foreign minister Dr Momen while discussing the book said when “we are talking of trade
and other policies, one can look into the consumer or effective demand, domestic effective
demand and how to design policy packages so that the domestic effective demand continues to
grow, to give the economy a byproduct.”
He gave an example of the US and said the major income of the US comes from the domestic
market, the consumer market.
""The contribution of the US government to GDP is around 21% and private sector contribution is
around 70%, totalling 91%. So, 91% of GDP contribution, we say, comes from the consumer
market. So it is an economy that runs with its own people.”
Even in India, he said, 70% of GDP comes from the private sector and 14% from government
expenditure. “And in Bangladesh, the government sector is larger–it is 26% as per the estimates
here.”
Former state minister for foreign affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury and former principal officer of
the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen (Retd) Mahfuzur Rahman was also present at the event,
jointly organized by the Diplomats World magazine, FES Bangladesh and the Centre for
Alternatives.

Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen has said that China is truly committed to helping
Bangladesh in its development and construction.
He made the comment while taking part in an interaction with Dhaka Tribune Editor Zafar
Sobhan and senior journalists during a courtesy visit to the newspaper’s office at Panthapath.
Highlighting the deep-rooted people-to-people ties spanning over a thousand years of friendly
exchanges, Wen underscored the mutual principles of respect, equality, and win-win cooperation
between the two nations.
Reflecting on his one-year-and-two-month tenure in Dhaka, the ambassador noted the warm
reception of the Bangladeshi people towards China.
“Over the past year I have visited many places in Bangladesh, had extensive contacts with all
sectors of society and reached out to the grass-roots people. What I have experienced most is the
simple and sincere affections of the Bangladeshi people towards China and the Chinese people,”
he said.
“Public opinion is the foundation of bilateral relations, and also the biggest source of confidence
for us to work together for the future,” the envoy added.
Pointing out that Bangladesh was the first country in South Asia to join the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), he said the BRI has “taken root and blossomed in the golden Bay of Bengal”
over the past eight years, being involved in and witnessing the sweeping changes that have taken
place in Bangladesh.
“It is no exaggeration that the city of Dhaka looks like a big construction site, and is vibrant and
alive with new projects every single day,” he said, mentioning that 14 mega infrastructure
projects either completed or commenced during the past year were aided or constructed by the
Chinese government.Publish : 05 Mar 2024, 09:21 PM

Dhaka Tribune Editor Zafar Sobhan stressed the need for further enhancing people-to-people ties,
and suggested that both countries explore the potential of tourism. In response, the ambassador
said direct flights between Dhaka and Beijing would be started soon.
The envoy lauded Bangladesh’s economic growth and political stability, and said: “We can learn
from each other and work together”.
Editor Zafar Sobhan also suggested the establishment of a high-speed train network in
Bangladesh
“There's no part of Bangladesh which is more than 300 miles from Dhaka. There are no two
places in Bangladesh which are more than 600 miles,” he said while sharing the idea of
connecting all the divisional headquarters with the capital, which is centrally located.
“It could be very easy to do,” Zafar Sobhan said, as China makes the best railway networks in the
world.
When asked about the Chinese ""debt trap"", the ambassador called it western propaganda and said
Chinese loans are only seven percent of all foreign loans that Bangladesh receives.
Bangladesh also gets major loans from the World Bank, IMF and Japan.
Both of them discussed future cooperation in the media sector as well.

Says Jetro president
Kazushige Nobutani, president of the Japan External Trade Organisation
(Jetro), is scheduled to come to Bangladesh today along with Yasutoshi
Nishimura, minister for economy, trade and industry of Japan. Their visit is
aimed at discussing the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) the two
countries plan to ink in order to promote trade and investments.
In an email interview with The Daily Star, Nobutani spoke about investment
opportunities in Bangladesh for Japanese firms and challenges the face, among
other issues.
DS: A lot of Japanese companies located in China also want to relocate to other
countries, including Bangladesh. Do you think that Bangladesh has the
opportunity to attract some of them?
Nobutani: Japanese companies are trying to diversify the supply chain not only
from China but to other regions, especially the Association of South East Asian
Nations. I believe Bangladesh is one of them.
DS: How do you see the business potential for Japanese investors in
Bangladesh?
Nobutani: There are a lot of business opportunities for Japanese companies in
Bangladesh.
First, we see a lot of export-oriented industries utilising abundant human
resources in Bangladesh.
Since the 1980s, some Japanese companies, especially those based in the
Chittagong Export Processing Zone, set up export-oriented industries and they
are still doing very good business in Bangladesh.
Second, based on Jica's support, mega infrastructure development projects are
going on in Bangladesh. Since Bangladesh is one of the fast-growing economies in
the world, Japanese companies are showing great interest in developing
infrastructures in the country.
Third, there is a huge domestic market in Bangladesh. Jetro Dhaka is getting a lot
of queries from Japanese companies to market their products in Bangladesh. We
see more opportunities in domestic market-oriented businesses. Lastly, the ICT
and startup sectors are more focused areas in Bangladesh for Japanese
companies.
DS: Do you think Bangladesh could create an investment-friendly environment?
Nobutani: I appreciate Bangladesh's government for working very hard to
improve the business environment.
Our focused activity is to work with the government to create a more business-
friendly environment in Bangladesh. We normally get a variety of opinions from
Japanese investors regarding the business environment in Bangladesh and raise
these issues with related ministries and agencies. Bangladesh is sincerely
working to address the issues.
We believe that the success of existing Japanese companies will bring more FDI
from Japan. That's why we are working very hard to support the existing Japanese
companies.
DS: What initiatives should Bangladesh take to attract Japanese investments?
Nobutani: Japanese companies always compare business environment and
incentives when they decide on investment. To attract Japanese investments,
Bangladesh should have better business environment and incentives than other
countries.
Japanese companies have long experience in Asian countries, and we are ready to
support Bangladesh to have a better business environment based on our
experiences.
DS: What types of opportunities are available in Bangladesh for investments?
Nobutani: Japan is facing an ageing society and the population is going down. It's
high time for Japan to work together with Bangladesh to get the source of
economic growth for both countries.
Bangladesh is a time-tested friend of Japan and we believe that we can work
together for win-win relations in business.
DS: How can Jetro help Bangladesh attract Japanese investments?
Nobutani: Jetro works together with Bangladesh to provide investment
opportunities for Japanese companies. We don't have any shortcuts to promote
Japanese investment. I believe the shortest way is to address the issue one by one
to facilitate more business from Japan.
DS: What will the potential sectors for Japanese investors in Bangladesh in the
coming days?
Nobutani: Startup is a potential sector for investments for Japanese investors.
Startups are growing industries in Bangladesh, and we believe Japanese
companies can collaborate with them to deliver services.
Energy is a sector that is vital for realising a carbon-neutral Bangladesh. So, it is
important for Bangladesh to introduce environmental-friendly energy.
DS: Do you think Japanese investors face any obstacles to investment in
Bangladesh?
Nobutani: There are a number of obstacles to investment in Bangladesh. We see
bureaucratic challenges in custom procedures and tax administrations.
We want more transparency and predictability in administrative procedures. I
believe that digitalisation and one-stop service would be good methods for having
a better environment.
Amid the Ukraine war, the world is facing difficulties owing to the price hike of
energy and essentials. Bangladesh is not an exception.
As Bangladesh needs to import raw materials, foreign exchange regulations are
crucial for Japanese companies to operate businesses. Once the difficulties are
over, I'd like to expect Bangladesh's government to take initiatives for better
regulations in the foreign exchange policy.
Japanese companies would like to contribute to industrial diversification in
Bangladesh. However, industrial diversification takes long time for getting
investment and technical transfer from outside.
In order to do that, long time and consistency in the policies are crucial. We
would like to emphasise that Bangladesh learns from Japanese companies to
develop industries.
DS: How can Bangladesh increase exports to Japan?
Nobutani: Bangladesh should increase the portfolio of export goods, especially
value-added goods in the RMG sector. Japan and Bangladesh governments have
set up the joint study group for bilateral EPA in December.
EPA is more comprehensive than free trade agreement (FTA). According to our
survey, 85 per cent of Japanese companies in Bangladesh are wishing to have a
bilateral FTA or EPA before Bangladesh graduates from the LDC group in 2026.
We also came to know that without FTA or EPA, 20 per cent of existing Japanese
companies in Bangladesh would consider relocation or reduce procurement from
Bangladesh in the future. I believe EPA would not only avoid relocation but also
help Bangladesh to increase exports to Japan.
DS: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, during his visit to India in April,
touted the idea of a new industrial hub for the Bay of Bengal and northeast
India. How will it be materialised?
Nobutani: The Japanese government would like to work with Bangladesh to
realise ""Free and Open Indo Pacific"". In the prime minister's speech, Bangladesh
was cited as the hub of the region.
Japan is supporting to develop Matarbari deep seaport. The seaport will be the
gateway to approach the northeastern region of India. At the end of the day,
Matarbari could be the hub for exporting to other regions. Literally, Matarbari
would be a game-changer in this region.

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) could help Bangladesh achieve its long-term
development goals in the current shift of global political economy, experts at an
international conference said on Sunday.BN
25/05/2025, 11:18 BRI can speed up BD attaining development goals: Experts | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/bri-can-speed-up-bd-attaining-goals-experts-1568001658 1/8They said both political and economic world orders have been changing quickly without
any war and protectionism seems to be on the rise in countries.
In the circumstances, they said, countries like Bangladesh should take BRI as a key option
to ensuring its foothold on the path of sustainable development through improving both
physical and non-physical infrastructure.
To reap the benefits of the Chinese flagship investment project, economists, bureaucrats,
academicians and businesses have stepped up discussions between the two countries for
responding to emerging challenges.
They also warned that a lack of open, transparent and competitive procurement process
could lead to poor performances on projects in terms of missing timeline, cost overruns
and low-quality services.
The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), a key national think tank, hosted the daylong
conference on ""Belt and Road Initiative, Positioning Bangladesh within Comparative
Perspectives' in the capital.
The leading businessman and member of the CPD board of trustees Syed Manzur Elahi
moderated the inaugural session of the event.
Industries minister Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun was present as the chief guest.
CPD chairman Prof Rehman Sobhan said BRI is a new evolution in the global economic
order with relocation of competitive powers into the countries in the South, South Asia in
particular.
He said China has huge foreign exchange reserves and sovereign wealth funds and it is
deploying its resources in a much organised way to bring about the restructuring of the
global economic order.
""This is a very extraordinary development,"" the eminent economist added.
Mr Rehman said Bangladesh should take the BRI agenda and continue dialogues with China
opening up a much broader conversation to address major elements of the initiative.
""BRI infrastructure will lay the groundwork for industrial restructuring, targeting market
opportunities being offered by China,"" he stated.
Mr Rehman also suggested long-term equity for the people who would be displaced for
infrastructure projects under BRI alongside stressing the importance of think-tank25/05/2025, 11:18 BRI can speed up BD attaining development goals: Experts | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/bri-can-speed-up-bd-attaining-goals-experts-1568001658 2/8collaboration on areas of research.
 
At the event, the industries minister said the bilateral relationship has reached a new height
in recent years following recent visits of both heads of the countries.
""No nation can progress in an isolated way. BRI is a platform of international cooperation
for mutual benefits,"" he said while sharing the experience of his recent trip to Beijing to
participate in the Second BRI Forum.
Presenting a keynote paper, CPD executive director Dr Fahmida Khatun said infrastructure
investment by 2040 for energy and transport sectors will be around 1.5 and 1.0 per cent of
the gross domestic product (GDP) respectively.
She said the largest proportion of BRI projects in Bangladesh is in the energy and transport
sectors. ""So, BRI effectively and efficiently fills the infrastructure gap here,"" she said.
About the debt sustainability issue, Ms Khatun said despite the recent trend in increased
external debt, Bangladesh's good debt servicing record has ensured that it has not piled up.
""The total debt service as a percentage of the total exports decreased from 8.6 per cent in
2013 to 3.9 per cent in 2018,"" she added.
Mahbub Uz Zaman, the newly appointed Bangladesh ambassador in Beijing, said BRI is
matched with the country's foreign policies and national priorities.
He said Bangladesh needs strong economic fundamentals to achieve its 2021, 2030 and
2041 development goals and BRI can help the nation in this regard.
Senior foreign secretary Md Shahidul Haque said the overall politico-economic order keeps
shifting in line with the ongoing global transformation.
BRI is wedded to the global structures like Indo-Pacific Strategy and Eurasia component, he
added.
""We should be a party to all the initiatives as long as they serve our national interests. It's
not only about trade, business and technology transfer. It's also about geopolitics. When
power shifts, it creates all kinds of wins.""
Moderating the event, Mr Manzur Elahi called for the government to consider stakeholders'
opinions in any policymaking.25/05/2025, 11:18 BRI can speed up BD attaining development goals: Experts | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/bri-can-speed-up-bd-attaining-goals-experts-1568001658 3/8""BRI is good but it has to be BRI-plus Europe because we also need developed countries for
our markets,"" said the captain of industry.
""Bangladesh doesn't want to be a market, rather we want markets. Protectionism doesn't
work. You need import and export,"" he went on to say.
Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) director general Dr Sachin
Chaturvedi and Prof Cheng Min of the Institute for Bangladesh Studies at Yunnan Academy
of Social Science, Kunming, also spoke at the programme.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/379237/want-to-be-good-close-neighbours-says-prof-yunus 1/4Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Monday reaffirmed Bangladesh’s commitment to
deepening bilateral relations with China and described his recent visit to China as a turning point
in the relationship between the two countries.
“This is just the beginning. We are so close, yet so far. Let’s change that,” said Prof Yunus,
welcoming Governor Wang Yubo of Yunnan Province on his first visit to Bangladesh.
“We hope you will visit us again soon — we want to be good neighbours, but more importantly,
very close neighbours,"" he said during a high-level meeting with the Governor at the State Guest
House Jamuna.
The chief adviser recalled his recent visit to China, describing it as a turning point in the
relationship between the two countries.
He praised China for its warm hospitality and expressed gratitude to President Xi Jinping for his
encouraging words on strengthening ties between the two countries.
Governor Yubo responded warmly, saying: “My visit is aimed at further strengthening our
bilateral relationship. Yunnan is ready to serve as China’s open hub for South Asia.”

exchange, healthcare cooperation, education, and trade, said the Chief Adviser's press wing.
Governor Yubo noted that a Chinese bank in Yunnan had already adopted the microcredit system
pioneered by Prof Yunus. “Many people in China are benefiting from this approach,” he said,
highlighting shared social goals between the two nations.
Governor Yubo proposed expanding cooperation in vocational training and digital and language
education, as well as promoting trade in sectors like seafood, mango and agricultural products.

The chief adviser endorsed the governor's suggestions. “We agree on everything you said – from
health and education to trade and training. We want to implement these things faster than ever.
We want to become closer partners and true friends.”
Healthcare emerged as a key focus during the meeting.
The chief adviser expressed appreciation for China’s support in launching medical tourism,
including the designation of four hospitals in Kunming for Bangladeshi patients. “This
cooperation is a new chapter in our partnership,” he said.
Both sides also agreed on the importance of enhancing educational exchanges.
Currently, around 400 Bangladeshi students are studying in China, and Professor Yunus pledged
to increase that number significantly. “We will encourage more of our youth to study in China

with China even more closely to address shared challenges and unlock new opportunities for
prosperity.

Bangladesh: Ambassador

Last update on: Sun Mar 13, 2022 02:18 PM
China will not build any military base on foreign land, including Bangladesh,
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming said today.
He made the remark when his attention was drawn to a report carried by Nikkei
Asia, titled ""India wary of China setting up Bangladesh missile maintenance hub"",
published on March 11.
With China preparing to set up a maintenance facility in Bangladesh for surface-
to-air missile systems it supplied in 2011, alarm bells are ringing in New Delhi,
the report said.
At the ""Spring Dialogue with China"", organised by The Business Standard at the
Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel, Li Jiming said China is not taking Russia's side in the
Ukraine war, rather it wants peaceful resolution through dialogue.
The Chinese Ambassador also referred to Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dr AK
Abdul Momen who said Bangladesh wants peace and that is what China exactly
wants.

'China dream' and 'Bangladesh dream' have blended well as both the nations partnered in
belt and road initiative (BRI), a top Chinese entrepreneur has said.
The two countries have great potential for stronger bilateral cooperation, he commented
on Friday.
""Bangladesh is a very important country in BRI. Since President Xi's visit to Bangladesh in
2016, they established a strategic partnership,"" said Jun Huang, secretary general of China
Top 500 Foreign Trade Enterprises Club, in Beijing.
He said President Xi sought to cooperate with Bangladesh in several major areas like power,
infrastructure, capacity building and agriculture to forge stronger bilateral ties.
Huang was speaking at a China-Bangladesh Business Forum organised by Bangladesh High
Commission and Top 500 Foreign Trade Enterprises Club at a Beijing hotel.
Around 40 Chinese entrepreneurs attended the programme.
Speaking at the event, Bangladesh Ambassador in Beijing M Fazlul Karim said China is a
major development partner now involved in multiple infrastructure and power generation
projects in Bangladesh.
Over the years, he said, China has emerged as the largest trading partner of Bangladesh
with a trade volume of more than $12 billion in 2017.BN

a bridge between South and South East Asia, Bangladesh is a very attractive place for
foreign direct investment.""
Karim said Bangladesh has qualified for graduating from a least developed country (LDC) to
a developing country status, reflecting key improvements in both social and economic
sectors.
The envoy said the government is in the process of establishing 100 special economic zones
(SEZs) and at least one hi-tech park in each district in the coming years for rapid
industrialisation.
""This is expected to transform Bangladesh into a major manufacturing hub in Asia,"" he
added.
""...Bangladesh is setting up a special economic zone for Chinese investors in Chittagong,
which will be ready for investment at the end of this year.""
Karim identified shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, garments and textile, agro-processing,
light engineering, ICT, jute, infrastructure, power generation and tourism for Chinese
investment.
Commercial counsellor of Bangladesh High Commission Md Mahfuzul Alam Khan,
Managing Director and CEO of Shandong Sinoking Dredging Equipment Co Ltd Wilson Zhao
and GEO Bangla Managing Director Abu Sayed, among others, also spoke at the forum.

Bangladesh will need Chinese economic cooperation and investment to address post-LDC

https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/324830/experts-chinese-economic-cooperation-needed-for 1/4They also said that after graduating, Bangladesh will face a number of new challenges including
economy, technology and other sectors.
In this regard, they urged Chinese investors to invest in Bangladesh on 100% ownership, joint
venture, or financial assistance basis.
They were speaking at a seminar titled “Stakeholders Consultation with Chinese Investors:
Challenges, Expectations, and Prospects” at the ongoing 3-day Belt and Road Initiative in
Bangladesh Exhibition 2023 in the capital.
Avijit Chowdhury, executive member (additional secretary of Bangladesh Investment
Development Authority (Bida), during his speech as chief guest said that Bangladesh was
marching forward and expected to graduate from the LDC status in 2026 and will be a developed
country by 2041.
Bangladesh is focused and supportive to the investors. As a stable country, it is high time to
invest in Bangladesh, he added.
Bida is working to resolve all sorts of challenges. The agency now has one-stop service (OSS) to
provide support to the investors with efficiency and quality, Chowdhury also said.
He also said that there are potential sectors like agro, technology, skill development and others
where China can invest and cooperate with Bangladesh for its smooth transition from the LDC.
Song Yang, commercial counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka, said that the business
environment in Bangladesh is developing and more Chinese enterprises will invest, they are
working on it.
“There are some issues like visa, LC, infrastructure which can be resolved to attract more
investment. By doing this, all expectations will eventually be a reality,” he added.
In his welcome remarks, Al Mamun Mridha, general secretary of the Bangladesh China Chamber
of Commerce and Industry (BCCCI), said that in 2003 when bilateral trade between Bangladesh
and China was worth $1.4, now it is worth almost $25 billion.
“Investments have also increased significantly over the past 10 years from $26 million in 2013, to
over $465.2 million in 2022 in the private sector. In 2016, over $40 billion was promised to

many projects have already been implemented,” he added.
BCCCI has acted as the strongest catalyst for this huge growth of these trade and investments, he
added.
Ke Changliang, president of Chinese Enterprises Association in Bangladesh (CEAB), said that
there are approximately 1,000 Chinese enterprises engaged in investment, trade or engineering
and construction services in Bangladesh.
He also said that Chinese enterprises in Bangladesh should solidify their confidence in the local
market, further expand, and extend investment activities in Bangladesh.
Most of them have decided to set up their South Asia regional headquarters in Bangladesh, he
also said.
“I trust it is our shared wish for all Bangladeshi governmental agencies and international or local
investors to improve the business environment by addressing the newly-emerging issues and
challenges,” he added.
In the panel discussion, representatives from Bida, Bepza, Bangladesh Bank, and Titas Gas
discussed various business-friendly developments of their respective organizations.
In the open questions session, Chinese enterprises raised questions on complications and time
consumption of e-Visa issues, tax issues, complication of project registration, custom issues,
foreign exchange and LC issues.
The government officials said though there were some complications, which they are working on
to resolve it.
Moreover, they also suggested that they apply for the above services by following the right
methods.
They also said that Bida, Bepza, utility providers, banks and other organizations are integrated to
provide services to the investors.
Gazi Golam Murtoza, president of the BCCCI made the closing remarks urging to resolve the
visa issues, import of smart LED TV, gas connection, and LC openings.

Bangladesh’s ascent to middle power means it will have to be more strategic than ever with
its diplomacy
Phot o: PMO

Update : 30 Sep 2023, 09:41 AM
 Publish : 30 Sep 2023, 08:00 AM
x25/05/2025, 14:57 A delicate balance of power
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/326661/a-delicate-balance-of-power 1/5In the heart of South Asia, Bangladesh, a nation of rich cultural heritage and a complex history,
has been quietly but resolutely ascending from its tumultuous past as a newly independent nation
in 1971 to its present status as a burgeoning middle power in the international arena.
This remarkable journey is a testament of national development, foreign policy success, and the
effective governance that has been put in place over the decades. From rapid economic growth to
unique geographical location along with global partnerships have made Bangladesh an influential
middle power.
This article explores Bangladesh's journey towards becoming a middle power and its relevance to
superpowers in the contemporary global landscape.
One of the most significant indicators of Bangladesh's ascent has been its economic growth and
development. Under “Vision 2021,” Bangladesh transformed itself from a least developed
country (LDC) to a developing one.
And “Vision 2041” has been adopted in line with “Vision 2021” to provide impetus to the dream
of the nation -- with the aim to end absolute poverty and become a developed nation by 2041.
Once Bangladesh was referred to as a “bottomless basket” after independence and now, it is the
second largest economy in South Asia.
Bangladesh's economic success has not gone unnoticed on the global stage. The country's
consistent GDP growth has led to its classification as a ""Next Eleven'' (N-11) economy, a group
of nations expected to play a significant role in the 21st century global economy. Bangladesh's
economic ascent is not only relevant to its own citizens but also to superpowers and the broader
international community. This potential economic growth is the reason why the US, China,
Russia, Japan, India and the rest of the world are paying attention towards Bangladesh.
Neighbours and beyond
Regarding the BCIM (Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar)) economic corridor, Bangladesh
plays a pivotal role in facilitating road, rail, and maritime connectivity within these four
countries. Indian critics of BCIM state that China cannot be trusted and here, BBIN (Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, Nepal) another economic corridor may boost regional cooperation and security in
this region.
x25/05/2025, 14:57 A delicate balance of power
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/326661/a-delicate-balance-of-power 2/5Thus, Bangladesh is one of the potential factors for both China and India in this region to
determine who will establish supremacy. Moreover, China has invested tens of billions of dollars
on Bangladesh's infrastructure, with projects like the Padma Bridge Rail link, Karnaphuli River
Tunnel, the Dhaka-Chittagong highway and many more.
These investments are part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and aim to enhance
connectivity between China, Bangladesh, and beyond. China's BRI is a strategy that seeks to
connect Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime networks to improve regional
integration, increase trade, and stimulate economic growth. China sees Bangladesh as an “all
weather friend” and one of their “strategic partners.”
In April 2023, Bangladesh formally announced its ""Indo-Pacific Outlook"" (IPO) to the world
emphasizing its principle of foreign policy (Article 25 of the constitution) which states
“friendship to all, malice to none.” The objectives include strengthening partnerships, promoting
dialogue, maintaining maritime safety and security, combating transnational organized crime
along with sustainable development, building resilient value chains, and enhancing health
security in these Indo-Pacific region.
China and the US
To counter Chinese influence in this region, the United States of America also announced their
“Indo-Pacific Strategy” that emphasizes America's vision for a free, open, connected, prosperous,
resilient, and secure Indo-Pacific region.
The bargaining position and competition between America and China have developed in this
region, especially regarding the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh's strategic location on the Bay of
Bengal makes it a crucial node in China's BRI. Bangladesh's geographic position offers a vital
route for China's trade and energy corridors, reducing its dependence on the Malacca Strait. On
the other hand, Bangladesh's location is significant for America's Indo-Pacific strategy, which
emphasizes maintaining maritime security, freedom of navigation, and regional stability.
Bangladesh's engagement with both China's BRI and America's Indo-Pacific strategy involves
careful diplomatic balancing. While it seeks economic benefits and infrastructure development
from China, it also values its strategic and security relationships with the United States.
The Bay of Bengal is enriched with natural resources that need to be explored with the
cooperation of developed countries along with higher technology. This prospect of a “blue
economy” has also increased the importance of Bangladesh to the outside world. If Bangladesh
x25/05/2025, 14:57 A delicate balance of power
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/326661/a-delicate-balance-of-power 3/5gives a special facility to any country in the Bay of Bengal, it can be a game changer in terms of
regional politics that will have severe global implications.
The recent visit of French President Emmanuel Macron in Bangladesh can be seen to consolidate
one of his country's Indo-Pacific strategies. Furthermore, Russian foreign minister Lavrov’s visit
to Bangladesh comes at a time when there is an invisible battle between the superpowers. From
their visits to Bangladesh, it is evident that not only regionally but also globally, Bangladesh is
now an emerging middle power.
Summits and confer ences
The recent BRICS and G-20 summits are also significant for Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh
could not become a member of BRICS this time, Bangladesh is a member of NDB (New
Development Bank) under BRICS and Bangladesh will undoubtedly be a promising country in
the next conference of BRICS.
At the G-20 summit, addressing “One Earth,” Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh
stressed on strengthening global solidarity and taking concerted efforts to tackle the global crisis,
giving a four-point recommendation.
She emphasized that for the sake of humanity, to establish peace and harmony throughout the
world, developed nations with major economies must come forward. Regarding climate induced
migration, she urged all to operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund as early as possible for
creating additional financing mechanisms and emphasized that in the upcoming COP-28, every
country should implement this fund with accountability and transparency.
Furthermore, she also emphasized Rohingya repatriation and the need for support of the
international community regarding this. Bangladesh also made “sideline diplomacy” in this
summit through having unofficial talks with various presidents and prime ministers of powerful
nations which have immense implications for further trade and investment opportunities.
Bangladesh's journey from a fledgling nation to a middle power is a remarkable testament to its
resilience and determination. Its economic growth, diplomatic initiatives, and soft power have
garnered the attention of economies large and small.
Bangladesh's relevance lies in its economic potential, regional significance, and extraction of
natural resources and contributions to global challenges. Cooperation with Bangladesh could
advance the interests of other economies and allow Bangladesh to continue its ascent on the
world stage.

China had grown quite strong too. These relations had strengthened further particularly
after the 2016 visit of the Chinese president Xi Jinping. And in continuity to theseRaheed Ejaz

25/05/2025, 10:01 Bangladesh-China relations: Overcoming uncertainties, moving forward
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/ds41oc1viy 1/5relations, the proximity between Awami League and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
was no secret either.
Under such circumstances, China had a certain sense of uncertainty and hesitation
concerning its ties with Bangladesh after the July mass uprising. China had been
concerned about the safety of its people involved in various mega projects in Bangladesh.
There are clear indications that the uncertainty and hesitation in Dhaka-Beijing ties
cleared up to a great extent with the recent China visit by the interim government's
foreign advisor Touhid Hossain. China's Communist Party leader and foreign minister
Wang Yi directly said Bangladesh has an importance place on their neighbourhood
diplomacy. And also that Beijing will fully respect Bangladesh's independence,
sovereignty and the aspirations of its people.
This is the first time that Beijing has publicly stated that Bangladesh features importantly
in its neighbourhood diplomacy. This is a significant statement in the changed global
circumstances as well as changes in Bangladesh, and the prevailing geopolitical situation,
even though China and Bangladesh have no common border. This statement reflects
China's desire to maintain close ties with Bangladesh in continuity to relations spanning
over five decades.
Also during Touhid Hossain's China visit, there was talk of certain pragmatic steps
regarding a new start to the relations that have stepped into the 51st year. This is clear in
the decisions to assist Bangladesh's flagging health sector to take services to people's
doorsteps, increasing trade between the two countries by means of relocating industries
and providing significant credit concessions.
Analysts say that from a futuristic angle, Touhid Hossain's China visit can be seen as
adding a new dimension to Dhaka-Beijing relations, clearing away any existing dilemmas.
Certain pragmatic decisions were taken during this trip. There is a strong message of
China's political support for Bangladesh. But strategic changes have emerged in Beijing-
Washington relations after the change in the US power scene and this will spill over to
other countries. And so Bangladesh will have to maintain a sort of balance, keeping a
distance from the conflict between two superpowers like China and the US.
Speaking in an interview with China Media Group Bangla during his China visit, Touhid
Hossain said every government of Bangladesh has maintained good relations with China.
And in continuity of that, the present interim government also places importance on
relations with China. He said, ""I managed to explain (to the Chinese government) that we25/05/2025, 10:01 Bangladesh-China relations: Overcoming uncertainties, moving forward
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/ds41oc1viy 2/5are an interim government and may not stay long in power. Whatever decisions we make
to take relations forward, will be followed by the next government. It is important to
maintain this continuity in relations. I feel I have been able to make the Chinese
authorities understand this.""
New dimension to health sector
Fresh assistance for health services was discussed in talks between Touhid Hossain and
Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, CPC international department minister Liu Jianchau
and chairman of China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) Luo
Zhaohui. China welcomes Bangladesh's proposal to set up a thousand-bed Bangladesh-
China Friendship Hospital in Purbachal, Dhaka. The first friendship hospital of the two
countries to be set up with Chinese funding will be run by Chinese specialists. As it will
take a few years to construct and complete the hospital, Dhaka requested that at least four
hospitals in Kunming, China, be specified for treatment of patients from Bangladesh.
China responded positively to this request. China assured that if necessary, a few
specialised hospitals in Chengdu, next to Kunming, will provide treatment for
Bangladeshi patients.
No blanket concessions on credit
Foreign advisor Touhid Hossain had detailed discussions with the CIDCA chairman Luo
Zhaohui on the projects in Bangladesh funded by China. He requested the CIDCA chairman
to reduce the rate of interest of Preferential Buyer's Credit (PBC) and the Government
Concessional Loan (GCL) from 2-3 per cent to 1 per cent and to extend the repayment
period from 20 years to 30 years. He also requested for the commitment fee and
management fee on Chinese loans to be written off.
The CIDCA chairman said they have extended the time for repayment and will consider
further concessions in interest rates. Touhid Hossain requested increased Chinese funding
in future CIDCA projects to be implemented in Bangladesh.
Speaking to diplomatic sources in Beijing, it was confirmed that China's foreign minister
Wang Yi had in principle agreed to extend the loan repayment time for Bangladesh, but
not on all projects. China will take the decisions to reduce interest rates, extend
repayment time and increase the rate of project funds in accordance to the projects.
Relocating industries to Bangladesh25/05/2025, 10:01 Bangladesh-China relations: Overcoming uncertainties, moving forward
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/ds41oc1viy 3/5From last September China has been talking about relocating industries to Bangladesh.
This matter featured importantly during this trip too. To this end, Touhid Hossain visited
an electric vehicle, robotics and agricultural processing plant in Shanghai. Talks were also
held with Shanghai's business chamber in this regard.
Speaking to Touhid Hossain in Beijing, CPC's international department minister Liu
Jianchau said China must relocate its industries. The matter of China relocating industries
to Vietnam also arose during the talks. Chinese leaders consider Bangladesh suitable for
relocation of their industries because the facilities to manufacture products in Bangladesh
and export these to other countries the matter of incentives in exports, will be beneficial
to China.
Procuring 10 aircraft with Chinese credit
China Southern Airlines, one of China's three largest airline companies, wants to sell 10 of
its aircraft. China has already contacted Bangladesh regarding the procurement of these
used aircraft at discounted rates. This matter was raised at talks during this trip. China
will sell these aircraft to Bangladesh on credit and grant funds released by CIDCA. The
matter will be sorted out after talks between the Civil Aviation Authority and Southern
Airlines.
Support in politics and reforms
Touhid Hossain visited China at a time when Bangladesh is focused on reforms and a
progression to democracy. Naturally Wang Yi and Liu Jianchau wanted to know about the
political situation in Bangladesh during talks with Touhid Hossain. The foreign advisor
apprised them about how Professor Yunus' interim government wanted to carry out
reforms, the latest update in this regard and the plans concerning the election.
The Chinese leadership emphatically stated they respected the views of the Bangladesh
people. They had no desire to interfere in Bangladesh's affairs. China was working in close
collusion with the past government in Bangladesh, and is working with the present
interim government too. It is in contact with BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and the other parties
too.
Speaking to Prothom Alo in this regard, president of Bangladesh institute of Peace and
Security Studies (BIPSS) Maj Gen Muniruzzaman (retd) said, China has expressed a
positive mindset concerning relations with Bangladesh. The possibility of massive change
in the country's dilapidated health sector with Chinese assistance has come forward. The
opening of health tourism with Kunming may curtail dependence on India for health25/05/2025, 10:01 Bangladesh-China relations: Overcoming uncertainties, moving forward

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), reminiscent of the Silk Road, is a long-term
infrastructural project that would stretch from the heart of China, all the way to Europe
which will help Asia cope with infrastructure financing gaps.
This was echoed by President of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS)
Major General ANM Muniruzzaman and Editor of Dhaka Tribune Zafar Sobhan in their
remarks at the BIPSS-Dhaka Tribune Roundtable titled, 'Belt and Road Initiative (BRI):
Connecting the World', which was held at the Westin, reports UNB.
The BRI project of China will create partnership linkages among the sub-regions of South
Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. BRI presents an array of opportunities for
Bangladesh, they said.
The roundtable was attended by diplomats, scholars, security experts, and youth
representatives from various disciplines.
BIPSS President Muniruzzaman highlighted the key facets and variables concerning BRI, the
underlying opportunities and challenges, and what it means for Bangladesh to maintain a
strategic balance being a member of the grand infrastructural initiative.
He said BRI is happening at a time when significant changes are taking place in the
international system, according to a media release issued on Monday.
Zafar Sobhan, editor of The Dhaka Tribune, in his welcome remarks said it is important to
take a deeper look at BRI projects, including how they may affect Bangladesh.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/belt-and-road-initiative-to-create-partnership-linkages-roundtable-1640002749 1/5Muniruzzaman further discussed how Bangladesh has a significant geostrategic role in BRI.
“We expect that BRI projects shouldnʼt cause any harm to the environment,” he added.
While discussing the project of the century, Muniruzzaman focused on how BRI
encompasses several continents in a network of roads and sea-routes.
The first keynote speaker, Dr. Fahmida Khatun, Executive Director of Centre for Policy
Dialogue (CPD), began her remarks with an emphasis on the economic and trade benefits
of BRI, and its implications for Bangladesh.
During her speech, she also highlighted the infrastructural gap currently existing in
Bangladesh and BRI will be a key supplement to fulfilling this gap.
Fahmida Khatun said it is imperative for Bangladesh to follow a cautious approach
regarding Chinese investments.
Highlighting the role of BRI member countries, second keynote speaker Parvez Karim
Abbasi, Assistant Professor of the Department of Economics at East West University, began
his deliberations by talking about the geo-economic implications of BRI for the region.
He also highlighted the fact how the whole project of BRI is actually an integral part of the
Chinese socioeconomic identity.
Abbasi added, “BRI is a concrete manifestation of Chinaʼs emergence as an economic
powerhouse and it will help expand connectivity transcending the borders between
nations.”
He said the fate of China is intrinsically linked to BRI. ""Due to the pandemic, thereʼve been
major economic implications for the world. The small states need to take each step with
precision and clarity. The role of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has to be
studied with in-depth details.""
Summarizing the discussion, Muniruzzaman said although there will be major implications
for the signatory countries, they need to utilise the funds channeled through BRI for the
prosperity of our nation.
An interactive session with the audience was followed who further enriched the discussion.
The participants included foreign diplomats, security sector personnel, scholars and
journalists.

 25/05/2025, 15:12 Political branding of Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/others/special-supplements/377303/political-branding-of-bangladesh 1/6Bangladesh lacks branding. Branding is about marketing, shaping perceptions, and keeping a
lasting taste in the mind of the receiver. What this country has and can offer is hardly out there in
a comprehensive and systematic manner. 
The July Revolution, an aspiration of the younger generation, who were forced to conform to the
narrative produced and circulated by a particular polity, has put Bangladesh on the map in a
positive perspective. A continuation of the drive of school children since 2018, who wanted to see
a system that will listen to “people” and embody “justice” in its deliberations, helped us, the rest,
with breathing space to speak aloud. Naturally, I would like to see its reflections in the branding
of Bangladesh -- it has been 54 years and it is due!
How do we brand Bangladesh from a political perspective? Coming from an international
relations background, I see the branding of Bangladesh not only from an economic point of view
but first and foremost as introducing Bangladesh to the rest of the world using its tangible power. 
The political branding of Bangladesh would pave the way for its economic branding. Here, I will
emphasize on two fundamental tangible elements -- the location of Bangladesh and its size -- to
illustrate how Bangladesh can be politically branded and presented as a country with strategic
significance.
Location, location, location
We overemphasize the size of Bangladesh as a “small” country -- and I will come to why this is
problematic later -- but we ignore even those who like to propose Bangladesh to be so for
ignoring the location value of the country. xxAdvertisement: 0:02Advertisement: 0:02
 25/05/2025, 15:12 Political branding of Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/others/special-supplements/377303/political-branding-of-bangladesh 2/6From being locationally challenged, land-locked (when Bangladesh was yet to resolve its
maritime boundary disputes with Myanmar and India), and even as “India-locked” (due to
sharing the fifth largest land border in the world with India being surrounded by it on its three
sides), Bangladesh certainly is now locationally endowed and blessed. 
What changed? 
Bangladesh’s legal victory over Myanmar and India in securing its unfettered access to the Bay of
Bengal and consequently being a player in the Indo-Pacific region (IOR) has shifted its
geographical disadvantage to a geo-political gain. 
With the turning of the Bay of Bengal as a legit gateway to the Indo-Pacific for Bangladesh, it not
only gained liquid territories and acquired a new identity as a “maritime country,” but it also
brought a closer look to what Bangladesh can offer to its neighbours. 
More than ever Bangladesh’s location in the middle of India -- the India Proper and the Northeast
Region (NER) of India -- has become significant from a strategic and economic point of view. A
friendly Bangladesh is in India’s interest for creating a prosperous NER. 
Be that as it may, Bangladesh’s first deep sea port will also add more tales to this story. India’s
deep sea port on its eastern side is too far to cater to Nepal and Bhutan’s requirements.
Bangladesh can offer a closer and cheaper alternative. This would be Bangladesh’s opportunity to
emerge as a regional hub of trade and commerce.
More on the location that often averts our critical scrutiny. We have neglected to learn about
Myanmar. 
We had Myanmar-blindness in our academic discourse and foreign policy until the latest
Rohingya crisis unfolded. It is not an easy task to home, feed, and maintain a semblance of
normalcy with 1.2 million Rohingya in Bangladesh. 
The situation became more complicated as Myanmar, the sending country, is facing hurdles to
keep afloat if we indulge ourselves in a maritime expression. With the rise of several actors
fighting against the Tatmadaw to gain control of the country, it is the Arakan Army, which is of
immediate interest to Bangladesh. 
Bangladesh has established operational contacts with the Arakan Army, hoping for a positive
outcome when the time is right. While the immediate concern is to ensure the repatriation of the
stranded Rohingya, given the global commitments for the maintenance and support of the
population turning challenging for Bangladesh, there is another geo-political concern too. xxAdvertisement: 0:02Advertisement: 0:02
 25/05/2025, 15:12 Political branding of Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/others/special-supplements/377303/political-branding-of-bangladesh 3/6We missed our opportunity to study and learn about Myanmar in-depth as our gateway to
Southeast Asia. Despite Bangladesh opting for an Act East Policy, the policy-makers perhaps paid
attention to “big players” instead of learning to make bridges -- so to speak -- to reach those big
players. 
Connectivity is not only about making transactions with big powers, but also about making the
best use of the land and maritime connections to create sustainable and durable relationships. A
former proposal of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) Corridor would have served
Bangladesh’s purpose of making its connectivity to Southeast Asia and to China via Myanmar,
which later also became a part of China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). 
If this is pursued with the right motives once again, and more importantly, if Bangladesh can
convince Myanmar and China to have direct connectivity between Bangladesh and Myanmar
through the corridor, this will open up a vista of Bangladesh’s real eastward opportunities. 
To tease the point further, have we thought of creating more opportunities for accessing the
Indian Ocean, apart from limiting ourselves to having zoning areas in the Bay of Bengal? Just as
India is investing in the Kaladan Project to ensure its further eastern access to the Indo-Pacific,
why are we not also thinking of a friendly Myanmar and ensuring sea access for Bangladesh on
Myanmar’s eastern coast? 
As the contemporary reality goes, there are two Myanmars that exist for us. We need to chalk out
our plans and make the best use of this situation. The work has to start now!
Expanding on the “small” talk
Now let me come to the “smallness” of Bangladesh -- which I find deeply troubling. We have to
live with the size of the country. Is it only the geographic expanse or what the geographic expanse
can hold and offer us that should determine its smallness? 
There is a light proposition about the reform of the United Nations Security Council’s permanent
membership based on population. Being the eighth largest country in terms of population,
Bangladesh would have had a decent chance to make it there. 
Kidding aside, we often forget or do not know that Bangladesh provides the second largest online
labour in the world. In a recent world demographic projection, Bangladesh would supply the
fourth largest labour force in the world by the year 2050. 
These are not just numbers but in the face of the graying of the greats, Bangladesh’s manpower, if
skillfully prepared and routed to strategically targeted markets, can be yet another tangible asset.xxAdvertisement: 0:02Advertisement: 0:02
 25/05/2025, 15:12 Political branding of Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/others/special-supplements/377303/political-branding-of-bangladesh 4/6Instead of prioritizing the traditional markets to export manpower, it is time to think of diversified
options and strategize keeping in mind growing markets and jobs that Bangladeshis can learn and
adapt to.
A new shift
The July Revolution of Bangladesh has fundamentally altered the nature of politics for the
country -- both internally and externally. It sent a strong message to the world that this is not only
a changed Bangladesh, but it also intends to reflect so in its dealings with the rest of the world. 
The chief adviser has provided an outline of the new Bangladesh, which will carry out its foreign
relations based on mutual faith, trust, and respect, as well as reciprocity. Bangladesh is well into
exerting itself as a middle power on the global stage, and this is what we need to vigorously
project. 
Such a political branding of Bangladesh will provide much-needed strategic autonomy where it
will be able to devise its foreign policy decisions and choices based on its national interests. We
must also keep in mind that such strategic autonomy can be either issue-based or independent
foreign policy decisions without being influenced by other parties.
Academics like to dream. We mark changes no matter how small they are, like to tie the loose
ends, and identify the patterns to weave the bigger pictures that we call theories. Theories can be
put into practice by taking practical actions. But I also have to acknowledge the changes taking
place around the world. 
The world is gradually entering into a turbulent phase. Age-old and stable relationships among
countries are being questioned. At the risk of sounding pessimistic, I am afraid it is the dawn of a
new era where countries are increasingly being pushed to fend for themselves. Bangladesh,
therefore, has to keep this in mind and start preparing sooner. 
There should be an exchange of visits composed of academics, policymakers, and writers to and
from Bangladesh who will be speaking and writing about the new Bangladesh. Narratives have to
be created, for as I have said before, if we do not step up to create our narratives, someone else
with a mightier pen will do so, and probably much to our dislike. 
In an age of social media and quick access to information, creative writing, story-telling, and
participation in global events will create the first of many steps to the political branding of
Bangladesh. Although one might sing along with Bill Clinton, “It’s economy, stupid,” in a

BRI to enhance trade, beef up

Analysts see opportunities, but warn of debt trap and environmental damage
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by China provides opportunity for Bangladesh
to improve its infrastructure, increase investment, trade and enhance
connectivity with countries in South Asia, but it also raises concerns of debt trap
CPD Chairman Rehman Sobhan speaks at an international conference on the Belt and Road Initiative at the Gardenia Grand
Hall in Dhaka yesterday. Photo: Star
and environmental damage, said experts yesterday.
To reap benefits from the BRI, Bangladesh should engage in conversations with
China to negotiate terms of loans and other issues, fix priority in selection of
projects, ensure transparency and accountability as well as focus on ensuring
governance related to the BRI schemes, they said.
They were addressing an international conference on the BRI and interests of
Bangladesh organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) at Gardenia Grand
Hall in Dhaka, which was attended by current and former diplomats, economists
and experts from China, India and Nepal.
“For Bangladesh, BRI provides an opportunity to seize benefits, particularly in
areas of trade, investment, connectivity, education and tourism, through strong
ties with countries particularly in the Southern Asia region, more specially, with
China and India,” said CPD Executive Director Fahmida Khatun in a keynote
presentation.
Launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, the BRI initiative, also known
as the New Silk Road, aims to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and
maritime networks through infrastructure and other connectivity related
investments.
The BRI aims to build connectivity and cooperation across six economic
corridors:  New Eurasia Land Bridge, China-Mongolia-Russia economic corridor,
China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic corridor, China Indochina Peninsula
Economic corridor, China Pakistan corridor and Bangladesh-China-India-
Myanmar (BCIM) economic corridor, she said.
China plans to rebuild the land network connecting China to Europe via Central
Asia and the maritime route from China to Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle
East and Eastern Africa, Khatun said.
By the end of July 2019, 136 countries and 30 international organisations signed
cooperation document in this regard.
The BRI spans across the territories of 72 countries, which covered 66.09 percent
of world population and 33.65 percent of global GDP as of 2018.
The initiative has generated a lot of discussion and speculation across the world
and China has established a Silk Road Fund with $40 billion.
Large Chinese banks have also become engaged in financing BRI projects in other
countries.
Bangladesh is connected with the BRI initiative through the BCIM economic
corridor that covers 1.65 square kilometres and includes 440 million people.
It connects China’s Yunan province with Bangladesh, Myanmar and India through
road, rail, water and air linkages, according to Khatun.
The Kunming–Kolkata corridor can reduce the costs of transport and benefit
Bangladesh through enhanced trade and investment.
Bangladesh has become a part of the BCIM and China promised to provide $40
billion investment in Bangladesh in bilateral assistance for infrastructure
projects and joint ventures.
Until now, the largest proportion of the BRI projects have been taken in the
energy and transport sectors, she said.  
“Thus, BRI effectively and efficiently fills in the infrastructure gaps in
Bangladesh.”
But sustainable financing of the BRI projects in the participating countries is an
important issue.
“This is the most important issue. In many countries, Chinese loans have become
questionable,” Khatun added.
China will need to structure its terms for financing of its BRI projects so that
recipients can sustain the debt and repay it through enhancement in their
production base and its diversification, said CPD Chairman Rehman Sobhan.
The BRI is indeed a global initiative to construct a new international order based
on enhancing development and ending poverty across the South within the
framework of a more equitable world order.
Sobhan suggested that countries such as Bangladesh engage in dialogue with
China and open up a much broader conversation on issues related to industry,
infrastructure and research initiatives on various issues.
“In the end, the BRI initiative is with individual country.”
The BRI looks at south-south cooperation (cooperation among developing
countries) and integration but so far the BRI initiatives by China are bilateral and
it needs to open up broader conversation.
“In the absence of any collective move to construct a new order China will have to
work out the specifics of its more comprehensive vision on a bilateral basis,” he
said, adding that work on identifying project priorities would be important.
Sobhan also suggested Chinese and Indian think-tanks to come together to assess
the concerns of the Indian government, which have so far kept them out of the
BRI process.
The BRI initiatives are viewed as development initiatives as the participating
countries are benefiting from investments made by China in infrastructure
projects, said Sachin Chaturvedi, professor and director general of the Research
and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS), New Delhi.
But partner countries often bring in issues like transparency in the projects,
environmental concerns, non-employment of local labour in construction and
operations and other works, he said, citing some projects in Myanmar, Thailand,
Sri Lanka and Lao PDR.
He, however, said when such mega projects are launched issues are likely to come
up.
“And the BRI is evolving as China has undertaken several mechanisms such as
debt sustainability programme,” he said, adding that China should initiate the
BRI in a framework that reconciles with other global initiatives.
Industries Minister Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun stressed on ensuring a win-
win situation with China and others when dealing with the BRI issues.
Bangladesh Ambassador-Designate to China Mahbub Uz Zaman suggested being
mindful of cost overruns and the interest rate of loans taken under the BRI
projects.
“The BRI is good but it has to be BRI plus Europe,” said Syed Manzur Elahi,
member of board of trustees of the CPD.
At the end of the day, Bangladesh needs developed markets to sell its products to,
he added.
In another session on economics of the BRI, Asif Ibrahim, executive council
member of ESCAP Sustainable Business Network (ESBN), said joint ventures and
technology transfer are important for Bangladesh.
The BRI projects should be developed in a way that factories remain in close
proximity to those. “I would like to see more exports going to China through BRI
initiative,” he said.
At the session, CPD Distinguished Fellow Mustafizur Rahman said governance of
the BRI projects has become important.
Sun Xiqin, editor of South and Southeast Asian Studies Journal, Yunnan Academy
of Social Sciences, Kunming, China, said no country would fall into a debt trap
because of cooperation from China.",0.137541098,0.400393172,,Positive

A preeminent method to enhance cooperation in the region could be the creation of a
regional fund or regional bank to finance aid projects, to prevent crisis and to provide
finance to the private sector. South Asia could take lessons from the experience of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) states in attracting intra-regional
investment funds. Even, mobilising foreign exchange reserves for development projects
and crisis prevention could play an important role. Secondly, establishing regional bodiesBN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/regional-significance-behind-bcim-ec-and-bri-projects-1562079853 1/9to manage size, directions and effect of policies could be an effective dose for boosting
regional economic cooperation in South Asia. Regional institutions are not only outcome of
negotiation processes but also drivers of negotiation processes.
Good examples of regional bodies in other regions of the world are European Commission
(EC) and European Central Bank (ECB) in EU, Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM)
in East Asian and ASEAN+3 Macro-economic Research Office (AMRO) and very recently, the
Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM-EC), which is in the offing. A
possible solution to increase financial cooperation can be the building and implementing
the mechanisms like Asian Clearing Union (ACU). However, the idea does not provide
enough incentives.
BCIM-EC CONNECTIVITY: The Kunming Initiative, which is currently known as Bangladesh-
China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM-EC) began its journey in August 1999 in
Kunming, the capital of China's southwestern Yunnan province. It has become an important
sub-regional cooperation mechanism in the region, aimed at greater integration of trade
and investment between the four countries. Subsequently, to facilitate and consolidate the
process of regional economic cooperation and create cross border trade and investment
opportunities both at public and private sector level, an organisation named as ""China
Kunming International Logistics & Finance Association (ILFA)"" has been set up in Kunming
with support from the Chinese Government. The forum as reached a consensus on
establishing non-governmental financing mechanism for China-South Asia International
Finance Opening and Cooperation. The Forum will also research on how to promote the
International Finance Opening and Cooperation and create and market innovative financial
products suitable for such objectives. Decisions taken at all meetings of the forum will be
submitted to quarterly meetings of BCIM-EC governmental working group, China-
Bangladesh governmental working groups, Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) leadership
summit and other bilateral and multilateral economic forums where China is participating.
OBSTACLES TO COOPERATION: In South Asian region, transaction costs are high due to high
prices of raw materials, high transportation costs, weak infrastructure and fragile financial
services. The lack of scope for direct investment has been another obstacle in the market
driven cooperation. Non-tariff barriers, such as inefficient border procedures, excessive
documentation, cumbersome custom procedures and inefficient port operations add
significantly to the transaction costs of intra-regional trade. Under the current scenario,
South Asian economies need to play a greater and stronger role in the regional cooperation
process. They have to avoid periodic provocations such as terrorist attacks or random
economic shocks. Member states should enhance their stance by willingness to grant
unilateral concessions. The common approach towards cooperation could be and must be
such that it will create a functional platform, where comparable connections of
interdependence, having common norms and confidence building, will be available.25/05/2025, 12:21 Regional significance behind BCIM-EC and BRI projects | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/regional-significance-behind-bcim-ec-and-bri-projects-1562079853 2/9AREAS OF COOPERATION: Again, in this context, South Asia Sub-regional Economic
Cooperation programme (SASEC) that was started in 1996 between Bhutan, Bangladesh,
India and Nepal for sustainable economic development could be extended to other areas of
cooperation and states of the region. Furthermore, governments need to initiate a plan and
negotiate with their counterparts on the one hand, and with domestic political lobbies, on
the other.
To prevent conflicts in South Asia, it is necessary to give a big push to the process of
regional cooperation both within and beyond the agenda of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Establishment of peace and financial consolidation was a
primary reason behind the initiation of regional cooperation process in war-affected
Western Europe in the 1950s.
ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETIES: Civil societies can act as catalysts in the initiation of regional
cooperation initiatives as they generally have a significant voice in the policy-making
processes of their respective states. This is also because of the fact that they are recognised
across borders for their academic, research as well as philanthropic activities. Civil societies
could therefore influence the regional cooperation process by providing a vision,
interpreting and explaining that vision to different stakeholders, especially multilateral
parties, in their respective nations. They can inform, educate and advocate the agenda of
different groups, to achieve a consensus on several regional issues having economic
importance.
SILK ROAD ECONOMIC BELT: In a bid to improve regional trade and nurture regional
development, the Chinese President Xi Jinping came up with the initiative of jointly
building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road, now
renamed as Belt and Road Initiative or BRI . He discussed the project during his visit to
Central Asia and Southeast Asia in September and October of 2013.
Essentially, the 'belt' includes countries situated on the original Silk Road through Central
Asia, West Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. The initiative calls for the integration of the
region into a cohesive economic area by building infrastructure, increasing cultural
exchanges, and broadening trade.
Apart from this zone, another area that is said to be included in the extension of this 'belt' is
South Asia and Southeast Asia. Many of the countries that are part of this 'belt' are also
members of the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The Maritime Silk
Road, also known as the ""21st Century Maritime Silk Route Economic Belt"", is a

particular.
More intimately the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Bangladesh-China-
India-Myanmar (BCIM) Economic Corridor are officially classified as ""closely related to the
Belt and Road Initiative.""
FINANCING RELATED PROJECTS: The Asian Infrastructure Investment Fund (AIIB) was
founded by China in 2014 with the participation of 56 other countries. It is a development
bank dedicated to lending for projects that are a part of the initiative. In November 2014, Xi
Jinping announced plans to create a US $40 billion development fund, also known as Silk
Road Fund, which will be different from the banks created for the initiative. As a fund, its
role will be to invest in businesses rather than lend money for projects. The Karot
Hydropower Station in Pakistan is the first investment project under the Silk Road Fund,
and is not part of the much larger CPEC investment.
Along with this, the 'Leading Group for Advancing the Development of One Belt one Road'
was formed sometime in late 2014 and its leadership line-up was made public on February
01, 2015. This steering committee reports directly to the State Council of the People's
Republic of China. It is composed of several political heavyweights, which is another
evidence of the importance of the programme to the Chinese government.
HISTORIC IMPORTANCE OF SILK ROAD: In March 2014, the Chinese Premier called for
accelerating the ""One Belt One Road"" initiative along with the Bangladesh-China-India-
Myanmar Economic Corridor and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor in his
government's work report that was presented at the annual meeting of the country's
legislature.
The Silk Road was a network of trade routes, formally established during the Han Dynasty.
The road originated from Chang'an (now Xian) in the east and ended in the Mediterranean
in the west, linking China with the Roman Empire. As China's silk was the major trade
product, German geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen call this route the 'Silk Road' in
1877. It was not just one road but rather a series of major trade routes that helped build
trade and cultural ties between China, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Persia, Pakistan, Iran,
Arabia, Greece, Rome and Mediterranean countries. It reached its height during the Tang
Dynasty. The popularity of the route declined in the Yuan dynasty, established by the
Mongol Empire, as political powers along the route became more fragmented.
The Silk Road ceased to be a shipping route for silk around 1453 with the rise of the
Ottoman Empire, whose rulers opposed the West.25/05/2025, 12:21 Regional significance behind BCIM-EC and BRI projects | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/regional-significance-behind-bcim-ec-and-bri-projects-1562079853 4/9BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI): At the heart of One Belt, One Road lies the creation of an
economic land belt that includes countries on the original Silk Road through South east
Asia, Central Asia, West Asia, the Middle East and Europe, as well as a maritime road that
links China's port facilities with the African coast, pushing up through the Suez Canal into
the Mediterranean.
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to redirect China's own domestic overcapacity and
capital for regional infrastructure development to improve trade and relations with ASEAN,
Central Asian and European countries. It could have as much impact on China's internal
economy as it will have internationally.
China's top priority is to stimulate the domestic economy via exports from industries with
major overcapacity such as steel, cement and aluminium. Most of these will be under build-
transfer-operate schemes in which large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will lead the way
while smaller companies will follow.
The domestic plan divides China into five regions with infrastructure plans to connect with
neighbouring countries and increase connectivity. Each zone will be led by a core province:
Xinjiang in the Northwest, Inner Mongolia in the Northeast, Guangxi in the Southwest and
Fujian on the coast.

Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Friday underscored the importance of
establishing seamless connectivity between Bangladesh and China through Myanmar,
highlighting the mutual benefits that can be reaped through such an initiative.
""We need seamless connectivity between Bangladesh and China, and the most viable route
passes through Myanmar,"" he said, emphasizing the necessity of a stable Myanmar and the
sustainable repatriation of Rohingya refugees to the Rakhine State.
""We hope for the return of a peaceful and stable Myanmar, including the return of the
Rohingyas to the Rakhine State with rights and security, so that this connectivity can be
established to ensure the mutual benefit of our people,"" he added.
Touhid made these remarks while inaugurating the International Conference on 'China-
South Asia Civilization and Connectivity: History and Contemporary Issues' at North South
University (NSU) in Dhaka.
The foreign affairs adviser highlighted Bangladesh's strategic location and growing
economic potential, asserting the country's commitment to fostering connectivity that
benefits all stakeholders.
""This would go a long way in driving economic growth, reducing poverty, and enhancing
cultural exchanges,"" he said.
Touhid further noted that regional connectivity has become increasingly crucial in
addressing global challenges such as climate change and economic uncertainty.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bangladesh-needs-seamless-connectivity-with-china-through-myanmar-touhid 1/4""In this era of global challenges, it is imperative that we work together with China, not just
as strategic partners but as friends,"" he said.
Referring to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), of which Bangladesh is a key partner,
Touhid said the initiative embodies the spirit of shared prosperity.
""The development of infrastructure, trade corridors, and people-to-people exchanges
under this initiative aligns seamlessly with aspirations for sustainable development and
regional integration,"" he observed.
The adviser reiterated the significance of enhancing the Bangladesh-China partnership,
which has evolved into a 'Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership' this year.
""This new partnership is built on the very foundations of trust, mutual respect, and a
shared vision of a brighter future,"" he said.
However, Touhid pointed out the need to address contemporary challenges such as
geopolitical tensions, climate change, and economic disparities through collective action.
""As responsible neighbors, China and South Asian nations must work together to ensure
peace, stability, and development in the region,"" he emphasized.
Touhid also acknowledged the transformative spirit within Bangladesh, referring to the
recent mass upsurge led by the country's youths.
""This renewed sense of purpose, what we refer to as the spirit of a 'New Bangladesh,' is a
commitment to building a more inclusive, equitable, and innovative society while
redefining our role on the global stage,"" he said.
The seminar was jointly organized by the China-South Asia Center for Sociocultural Studies
(CSCSS) of NSU and Yunnan University, China.
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen and NSU Vice-Chancellor Prof. Abdul Hannan
Chowdhury also spoke at the opening ceremony.

Belt and Road Initiative_ Perspective from Bangladesh _ The Daily Star.pdf,"Roundtables
Belt and Road Initiative: Perspective
from Bangladesh
Wed Aug 7, 2019 12:00 AM
Last update on: Wed Aug 7, 2019 12:55 AM
Major General A N M  Muniruzzaman, ndc, psc (Retd), President, BIPSS and
moderator of the session
The Daily Star and Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS) jointly organised a roundtable titled “Belt and
Road Initiative: Perspective from Bangladesh” on July 24, 2019. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
is a major undertaking. In the
words of President Xi Jinping
“This is the project of the
century”. It encompasses all three
continents in a network of roads
and sea-routes. More than 120
countries have already signed and
joined BRI. Bangladesh is also a
signatory country of BRI and also
is an important strategic member.
During the visit of President Xi
Jinping to Bangladesh in 2016, a
number of MoUs and agreements
were signed between Bangladesh
and China. Under the BRI
projects, Bangladesh will receive
$26 billion USD for BRI projects
and $14 billion USD for joint
venture project, together totaling
to a $40 billion USD package.
Bangladesh is a strategic maritime
nation and occupies a critical
access position to the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean. Therefore, one of the six
economic corridors of BRI will pass through Bangladesh; it happens to be one of
the two maritime corridors of BRI. This corridor, which starts at Kunming passes
through Myanmar, enters Indian north-east and through Bangladesh, ending up
in Kolkata. There is, however, some doubt and confusion regarding this corridor
as this was not mentioned in the post second BRI Summit declaration in April this
year. BRI has entered a new phase, since the vision was first declared by President
Xi Jinping in Astana, Kazakhstan in 2013 and it was explained during his visit to
Jakarta, Indonesia. It has been over five years since the work of the mega project
started. In the second BRI Summit held in Beijing this year President Xi Jinping
gave a number of policy directives regarding implementation of BRI. Projects in
the coming years, according to his vision, all BRI projects should also be clean
and green, meaning there will be zero tolerance for any corrupt practice. Projects
should be environmentally sensitive, not causing any environmental damage. A
number of initiatives were also declared; notable amongst them are, Belt and
Road Studies Network (BRSN), Belt and Road News Network (BRNN), Belt and
Road Energy Partnership (BREP) and Digital Silk Road Initiative (DSRI) to name a
few.
There is also a major emphasis now on digital BRI. In this age, connectivity
through physical network is no longer sufficient. Countries under BRI must be
digitally connected. Therefore, a BRI digital super highway will be built. All BRI
partners should re-evaluate and nations must exercise responsible borrowing so
that they do not fall in the so called debt trap. BRI is happening at a time when
the global system is going through a flux and major changes are taking place in
the international system. It is a complex world and as a member country of BRI,
Bangladesh has to move carefully, critically judging the situation and all its
consequences. We should try and get the best benefit of this major strategy which
can be truly called a grand strategy. There are risk factors involved in these
initiatives and decision should be based on our national interest.
 
Md Touhid Hossain, Former Foreign Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh
 We should understand the significance of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a
geopolitical concept. China has played an influential role in Africa in recent
times. This approach led to unstoppable rise of China. There were setbacks for
China in Maldives and Sri Lanka. China’s influence in South China Sea is growing.
In this region, ASEAN also have a role to play when comes to regional
cooperation. BRI is not going to immediately bring substantial change for
Bangladesh as the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the combined effort of
the partners in the region. India has not been a part of BRI in fear of being
encircled by China. BRI has triggered a conflict of interests between India and
USA. China is growing more powerful day by day both in terms of economy and
military. Countries can find it hard to repay any loan under the conditions of BRI.
There are limitations to pay back
the grossly overpriced projects.
We should look for partners such
as China to resolve the Rohingya
conflict while being more
practical on the connectivity
routes and their benefits.   
 
Dr S K T awfique M. Haque,
Director, South Asian Institute of
Policy and Governance (SIPG),
Department of Political Science
and Sociology, North South
University
There are changes that indicate
the economic slowdown of China.
The over capacity and huge
foreign exchange reserve of China
played a crucial role in the
process of economic slowdown.
USA is now putting emphasis on containment strategy to counter the rise of
Chinese initiatives such as Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese strategy of Belt and
Road Initiative is based on economic, cultural and geopolitical interests,
irrespective of the divergent discussions. BRI is going to expand the horizons of
connectivity, trade and infrastructure. There are also risks concerned with
environmental degradation and debt trap. BCIM corridor was proposed by
Rehman Sobhan in 1999. Bangladesh needs support from China for
infrastructural development, trade and business. Bangladesh should be patient to
wait for the outcome of BRI. There should be more discussion about Chinese
investment in Bangladesh. There are differences between China and Pakistan on
the issues regarding BRI. There are several researches coming out on BRI.
Bangladesh should not be over dependent on any country for resolving the
ongoing Rohingya crisis. 
 
 
Parvez Karim Abbasi, Assistant
Professor, Department of
Economics, East West University
The news of the demise of the USA
as a superpower is greatly
exaggerated. The recent Trump
led trade war and the Huawei
incident proves that its economic
prowess is still formidable. The
USA was the largest economy (in
terms of Purchasing Power Parity)
from 1871-2014. The Indo-Pacific
Strategy is a reflection of its
aspirations to retain its
superpower status.
 However, it is an incontrovertible
fact that China is closing the gap
fast between itself and USA and the Belt and Road Initiative is a concrete
manifestation of the Chinese economic clout. A few facts and figures will amply
illustrate that phenomenon. In 1900, the Chinese economy was 6 percent of US
economy. By the year 2011, the Chinese economy became 50 percent of US
economy. The Chinese economy is expected to exceed US economy and account
for 25 percent of global economy by 2050. China is the biggest export market for
43 countries. The country is also the largest exporter of manufactured products
in the world.
The accusation of Debt Diplomacy is often associated with BRI. However,
empirical research shows that the widely cited example of the acquisition of
Hambantota port by the Chinese has little to do with BRI. In fact, China is not
even the largest creditor of Sri Lanka. Rather, it is closely related to the servicing
of the prior $39 billion Sovereign
Bonds that were issued by the Sri
Lankan Government, whose
maturity period ends in 2019.
Chinese investments often were
misdirected to inefficient prestige
projects. The acquisition of
Hambantota however raises the
specter of String of Pearls theory
whereby Chinese dependence on
Singapore as a maritime hub
could drastically reduce in the
coming decades.
 China has committed to roughly
US$ 40 billion investment in
Bangladesh. Though
disbursement has been slow, it is
widely expected to invest in
power, infrastructure and
manufacturing industries. Most of
the loans provided by the Chinese
are commercial in nature, with
stiff interest rates.
The questions regarding the wisdom of debt financed investment is moot at this
point as these investments are crucial for the Bangladeshi economy. However,
some concerns remain such as the possibility of the Chinese economy slowing
down and its impact on BRI; the possibility of sudden rise in global oil prices and
slowing down of remittances and RMG exports and its effect on Bangladesh’s
ability to service its debts; the lack of adequate sensitisation of Chinese workers
in Bangladesh to local culture and tradition as demonstrated by the regrettable
Payra power plant incident; greater oversight and transparency etc.
However, BRI alone cannot be a panacea for all our economic woes.
 
Brig Gen Shahedul Anam Khan,
ndc, psc (Retd), Associate Editor,
The Daily Star
China has overcome the US
economy in terms of Purchasing
Power Parity in 2014. We must
understand that Belt and Road
Initiative is here to stay. China
cannot be blamed for her
aspirations as no other big
country came up with concrete
plans to reshape the current world
order. BRI is of greater
importance to China and the
project goes with the ever
increasing global demand for
infrastructure. It is also flexible as
it allows local and regional
integration. The enlarging
footprint of BRI in the region is
also another aspect.
There are discussions about Mombasa-Nairobi railway and Jakarta-Bandung
railway. Some of the projects of BRI are symbolic. Like any other infrastructural
projects, there are pros and cons of BRI. There are concerns of compromising
national sovereignty. China hopes to ensure that the ownership of a particular
infrastructure is not hampered. The domestic challenges that China faces in
terms of fund, high rate of unemployment and environment are also key
concerns. Ghost cities have been a major cause of concern in China.
Technological tsunami in the form of IOT, 3D printing, robotics, big data and
human cloud will outsource the white collar work all across the globe which
would cause serious unemployment. Unemployment will also impact developed
countries; USA will experience 47 percent unemployment, Japan will experience
40 percent unemployment and UK will experience 37 percent unemployment. BRI
as a project is subject to criticism. There are certain security concerns: debt,
disaster, absence of local employment, trickle-down effect of uncertainty,
consequences of disruption of projects within China and other countries as well
as the Chinese compass approach. There is a risk of miscommunication and
misperception about such a large approach. China recognises that debt trap
diplomacy is something which should never be repeated. BRI is the first step to
cover a thousand miles. BRI’s success depends on the social, economic and
political stability of China and all the participating countries. It is not judicious to
pick the Rohingya issue in all matters of cooperation. BRI should be based on our
package that represents our dreams and aspirations. We should be careful about
vanity projects.
 
 
Serajul Islam, Former Ambassador
There is a concern on the situation of Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh. We should
look at the balance of policies between Bangladesh and India to join the Belt and
Road Initiative. We should realise that BRI is not the solution for all our
problems. We should also realise that a large stake of our membership to BRI is
based on BCIM which is dependent on our ally, India.
 
 
 
Rear Admiral A S M A Awal, NBP, OSP, ndc, psc, MDS, MBA (Retd), Former
Ambassador & Assistant Chief of  Naval Staff
BCIM can act as a real transit
point linking together all the
countries. India and China are the
biggest trade partners. The issue
is whether India will sign up for
BRI. The rivalry between India
and China will determine the fate
of BCIM corridor. China and India
are our biggest trading partners as
well. The sideline meeting
between China, India and Russia
at G20 Summit caught the
attention of the press across the
world. There is also a point of
contention between India and
China on account of the Doklam
standoff. The national interests
should be preserved while
considering the selection of
projects. BRI and Indo-Pacific
strategy are two competing
projects which require
participation from Bangladesh.   
 
 
Penny Morton, Deputy High Commissioner, Australian High Commission in
Bangladesh
Bangladesh should emphasise on the use of international rules for the BRI
projects. It can also look for opportunities concerned with free trade, democracy
and other values that it can associate with BRI. Bangladesh should hold a genuine
interest in upholding the standards for BRI projects across the whole Indo-Pacific
region.
 
 
 
Shahed Akhter, Former
Ambassador
Bangladesh should concentrate on
the BRI and BCIM corridor.
Bangladesh has a genuine interest
in this part of BRI project because
it has a large volume of trade with
China. There were plans to build
Asian Highway 1 and 2. However,
the current status of the Asian
Highway is questionable. BRI will
also connect Asia with Europe.
United Nations ESCAP has also
actively worked for the
development of Asian Highway.
India has already taken note that
Bangladesh is going to be a part of BRI. We already have a MoU with Myanmar
concerning the Rohingya crisis. The countries who signed up for BRI are taking
keen interests on BRI.
 
 
Jacob J Levin, Political Officer, US Embassy in Bangladesh
There are talks on competition and market share. In this kind of debate, the
conspiracy theories always take precedence. We value relations with Bangladesh.
USA has been a key partner to Bangladesh in terms of trade, counter terrorism
and development. Currently there
is a focus on state led investment
but there should be more focus on
private investment. The share of
private investments went down
last year and that is a major
concern for Bangladesh. We have
experience and the resources
required to develop Bangladesh.
We want to collaborate with the
government of Bangladesh in
order to unlock the potential of
private sector in Bangladesh. We
need incentives for US companies
to invest in Bangladesh.
 
 
Dr Nadia Binte Amin, Managing
Director and CEO, Research and
Computing Services Private
Limited
There are concerns about Bangladesh in terms of incorporating our self-interests
with the BRI projects. We should emphasise on being more pragmatic to have a
positive impact on the Chinese position for BRI.",0.064119147,0.317794198,,Positive

China is ready to implement the Teesta River restoration project in collaboration with India
if Bangladesh wants, Chinese Ambassador Yao Wen said on Thursday.BN
25/05/2025, 11:48 China ready to implement Teesta project in collaboration with India: Yao Wen | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/china-ready-to-implement-teesta-project-in-collaboration-with-india-yao-wen 1/8Asked what will be Chinaʼs response if Bangladesh decides to implement the project with
the assistance of both China and India, the Chinese Ambassador said, “China is open as far
as it is conducive to Bangladesh. We are ready, China is open to whatever proposal
Bangladesh makes in this regard.”
The Chinese envoy made these observations while interacting with the members of the
Diplomatic Correspondentsʼ Association of Bangladesh (DCAB) in the capital city at a press
meet.
The envoy made it clear that Bangladesh has the sovereign right to decide by whom it will
implement the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project
(TRCMRP), and China will respect any decision taken by Bangladesh in this regard.
“I know many of you are concerned about it, but what I can tell you is that the Teesta River
is on the territory of Bangladesh. So that is your river,” he said adding that it is purely up to
Bangladesh to decide how they will implement and China will always respect the decision.
He said that the project needs to start very soon for the benefit of over 30 million people
residing on the banks of the Teesta River of Bangladesh.
Responding to a question he said that a ceasefire in Myanmar is a must to start the
Rohingya repatriation and China is earnestly working with all the stakeholders of Myanmar
to manage a ceasefire.
Addressing the programme the envoy said, as strategic cooperative partners, the China-
Bangladesh relationship is at its best of all time and is also embracing tremendous
opportunities for development.
He noted that the upcoming visit by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to China will be another
milestone visit in the history of bilateral relations and is of great significance to build on
past achievements and forge ahead.
“This visit will surely inject vibrant impetus into the bilateral relations and cooperation in
various fields, and promote new achievements in the Strategic Partnership of Cooperation
between China and Bangladesh, and elevate the relationship to a new height.”
He said the international situation is intertwined with turbulence and changes, with the
global development and security situation being intricate and complex. The world is
undergoing profound changes unseen in a century at an all-dimensional and deep-level
pace.25/05/2025, 11:48 China ready to implement Teesta project in collaboration with India: Yao Wen | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/china-ready-to-implement-teesta-project-in-collaboration-with-india-yao-wen 2/8“Against the aforementioned background, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to China is
highly anticipated by all walks of life. This visit is expected to take the helm for the growth
of the China-Bangladesh relationship for the next five years or even longer. The visit will
outline a new blueprint for practical cooperation in various fields and provide an
opportunity for the two countries to coordinate our positions in regional and international
affairs,” the envoy said.
Mr Wen also felt that through this visit, the two sides would achieve a breakthrough in
pragmatic cooperation, bringing more benefits to the people of both countries.
“It has been proved that China is Bangladesh's most reliable partner and most trustworthy
friend.”
On Bangladesh's journey toward modernisation, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is highly
consistent with the Vision 2041 and the dream of ""Golden Bengal,"" as well as Bangladesh's
national conditions. China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner and the second-largest
source of foreign investment. China's economic and trade cooperation with Bangladesh
comes with no political strings attached nor demands for special privileges.”
“Since Bangladesh joined the BRI, China has built seven railways, 12 highways, 21 bridges,
and 31 power plants in Bangladesh, he said adding that Chinese enterprises have brought
about more than 550,000 jobs in Bangladesh. China stands ready to work with Bangladesh
to achieve more practical results in infrastructure, digital economy, clean energy,
agriculture, education, healthcare, culture and people-to-people exchanges, thereby
assisting Bangladesh in its modernisation process”.
He stated that China supports Bangladeshʼs bid to become a partner country of the BRICS
and hopes Bangladesh will be a member of the BRICS at an early date.

meeting in Beijing on September 04, 2018: Two important documents - the Beijing
Declaration and the Beijing Action Plan (2019-2021) - were passed on Tuesday at the 2018
Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).The two outcome
documents were adopted at the two-phase roundtable meeting, which was jointly chaired

When the United Nations General Assembly met in 2007 to vote on North Korea's human
rights record, only 10 of the 56 African countries voted with the US-led western coalition.
The overwhelming majority followed China - either by voting against or abstaining from the
resolution.
This has not always been the case. Just three decades ago, the consequential General
Assembly vote to replace the Republic of China (Taiwan) with the People's Republic of
China - signalling international recognition of Communist Party rule - was met with
resistance from the United States. Although the resolution was passed, African countries
did not take any side.
In the interim three decades, China rose to be one of the world's most formidable economic
and military powers, surpassed the United States as Africa's largest trading partner and
financed more than 3,000 large, critical infrastructure projects.
More than 10,000 Chinese firms operate in Africa, claiming nearly 50 per cent of Africa's
internationally contracted construction market.
China transitioned from the world's supplier of cheap labour to a leading financier of the
developing world, aiming to build bridges - both figuratively and literally - through
economic cooperation. Its chief foreign policy project - the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) -
would connect 152 countries across continents and facilitate more than 1.3 trillion in trade.
Yet to the west, China's ascent means an authoritarian challenge to the liberal international
system.
In a foreign policy address last December, US National Security Advisor John Bolton warned
that China has been ""deliberatively and aggressively"" undermining US interests.
""China uses bribes, opaque agreements, and the strategic use of debt to hold states in
Africa captive to Beijing's wishes and demands,"" Bolton said. ""Such predatory actions are
sub-components of broader Chinese strategic initiatives… with the ultimate goal of
advancing Chinese global dominance.""
Although Washington is becoming increasingly alert on Africa, Beijing devised its own Africa
strategy long before the twenty-first century. 
Shortly after China's founding in 1949, much of the developing world was still struggling
with anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism. China's then-premier Zhou Enlai saw this as an25/05/2025, 12:24 How China's Africa Alliance is shifting world order | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/how-chinas-africa-alliance-is-shifting-world-order-1563722601 2/11opportunity to position China - a country that triumphed in the same struggle - as a leader
of the developing world.
""Africa's always been important for China going back to the 1950s,"" Dr. Stanley Rosen,
professor of political science at the University of Southern California's US-China Institute,
told IPS.
""In the earlier period under Mao, it was because of the number of countries in Africa that
had votes at the United Nations and the fact that China was promoting revolutionary
movements, so it's very political.""
""Shortly after the reforms began in China in 1979, Africa became more important
economically,"" Dr. Rosen added.
In the 1990s, encouraged by then-President Jiang Zemin's ""Go Out Policy"" - a government-
backed programme to incentivise private overseas investment - Sino-African trade grew by
700 per cent. With the help of the low-interest loans from the Chinese Export-Import Bank,
companies like Huawei spearheaded a new generation's quest for markets abroad.
Dr. Rosen told IPS that China now seeks to build mutually beneficial relationships with
resource-rich countries regardless of their domestic political situation.
In September last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged at the Forum on China-Africa
Cooperation (FOCAC) that China will provide an additional $60 billion in financial support
to Africa through foreign direct investment (FDI) and infrastructure loans.
Perhaps more telling of China's attraction, more African countries attended FOCAC than the
similarly-timed UN General Assembly meeting in 2018.
Xi calls China's foreign policy, ""major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics"" - a
doctrine that prioritises peaceful cooperation than single-power domination.
However, regardless of Xi's intentions, China's investment has boosted domestic economic
growth and gained political sway over willing African leaders who need technical aid and
infrastructure development.
More importantly, China has shown that the western-dominant model of development
characterised by neoliberal economic policies and democratic political principles is not the
only way. By doing so, China is shifting the eye of world affairs eastward.
In June, 43 African countries drafted a statement to oppose the US veto power on judicial
appointments at the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the world's25/05/2025, 12:24 How China's Africa Alliance is shifting world order | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/how-chinas-africa-alliance-is-shifting-world-order-1563722601 3/11highest trade court. Again, they sided with China.
China has urged the WTO to oppose US veto power since early last year. Zhang Xiangchen,
China's WTO ambassador, said the international trade system is facing ""grave challenges,""
referring to President Trump's trade policy.
""The most urgent and burning question that the WTO has to answer now is how to respond
to unilateralism and protectionism,"" Zhang said. ""What is most dangerous and devastating
is that the US is systematically challenging fundamental guiding principles by blocking the
selection process of the Appellate Body members.""
""If left untreated, [the policy] will fatally undermine the functioning of the WTO,"" Zhang
added.
China's challenge to the US-dominant world order doesn't stop with the WTO. China has set
up international institutions such as the New Development Bank and the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to further solidify its position as the developing
world's financier.
While some have argued that these institutions are potential rivals to the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), some are more cautious to assume that China is
attempting to change the international order because of China's lack of clarity in its policy
implementation process.
Dr. Yuen Yuen Ang, associate political science professor at the University of Michigan, told
IPS that China's intentions are ""not verifiable.""
""While observers are free to speculate upon China's intentions,"" Dr. Ang said. ""What we
should and can know for sure is a persistent gap between policy formulation and
implementation.""
Dr. Ang explained that the implementation of BRI has been ""fragmented and
uncoordinated,"" causing confusion for international partners and participant companies
and blurring Beijing's strategic vision.
Despite its flaws, however, the BRI is showing the world the China way.
On the 95th anniversary of the Communist Party's founding, Xi announced to a hall of
thousands that the Chinese people ""are fully confident in offering a China solution to
humanity's search for better social systems.""25/05/2025, 12:24 How China's Africa Alliance is shifting world order | The Financial Express

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/development/162991/expert-bangladesh-holds-important-‘geopolitical 1/3Bangladesh holds an important “geopolitical strategic position” in the Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) that offers “great potential” to strengthen economic and trade cooperation between
Bangladesh and China, says a Chinese expert.
""We should strengthen cooperation between the two governments, and at the same time focus on
strengthening inter-party exchanges,"" said Prof Li Tao, executive director of the Institute of South
Asian Studies at Sichuan University in China.
The BRI is a multi-billion-dollar initiative launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping. This mega
initiative emerged when President Xi came to power in 2013, reports UNB.
During Xi's historic visit to Dhaka in 2016, Bangladesh formally joined the “Belt and Road
Initiative,” a drive which has already drawn the close attention of the world.
Sharing her thoughts on development of Bangladesh-China relationship under the BRI, Prof Li
Tao said the two countries can accelerate the feasibility study on Bangladesh-China Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) and then start the negotiation accordingly.
""The FTA between Bangladesh and China can effectively reduce the trade deficit. This is very
important,"" she said emphasising the importance of actively promoting the feasibility studies to
that end.
Bangladesh and China will complete the exchange of letters for zero-tariff treatment to 97% of
tariff items exported from Bangladesh to China within a short time, to further boost the export of
Bangladeshi goods to Chinese market, according to Chinese Embassy in Dhaka.
Earlier, Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Zhang Zuo said both Bangladesh and China have highly
prosperous markets that attract businesspeople from all over the world. ""Faced with opportunities
and challenges, we should join hands to become good partners of mutual benefits.""
Ambassador Zuo said Bangladesh and China should maintain communication and consultation,
adhere to the basic principles of free trade, make necessary reforms to the World Trade
Organization while fully taking into consideration the interests of all parties, and safeguard the
developing interests and policy space of developing countries.

in big infrastructure projects like airports in Bangladesh.
Prof Li Tao also said China's investment in Bangladesh should promote the ""localization"" of
projects, dock local labour and employment needs, truly benefit both sides, and earnestly increase
local incomes.
She also laid emphasis on strengthening exchanges in the personnel, media cooperation,
cooperation in higher education and mutual recognition of academic qualifications.
Appreciating Bangladesh-China longstanding friendly relations, the Chinese expert said similar
development concepts of the two countries is the core of cooperation.
In 2017, bilateral trade value between the two countries reached $16 billion, 5.8% higher than
last year, with China remaining the number one 1 trade partner to Bangladesh, data shows.
In the first 9 months of this year, the bilateral trade value stands at $13.9 billion, with a growth
rate of 19.3% year on year, according to the Chinese Embassy.

Bangladesh's ascent as a middle power: A shift in geopolitical
landscape

Rapid economic growth due to its unique geographical location, the strategic location of
the Bay of Bengal and global partnerships, etc., has made Bangladesh one of the emerging
and influential middle power with various ramifications for global superpowers. This article
explores Bangladesh's journey towards becoming a middle power and its relevance to
superpowers in the contemporary global landscape.              
Bangladesh's economic growth and development is one of the most significant indicators
of its ascent. Almost an empty foreign reserve during war-torn Bangladesh to become a
$29.7 billion foreign reserve within only 50 years of independence is a miracle. 
Under 'Vision 2021', Bangladesh has transformed from Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to
a developing one. It aims to end absolute poverty and become a 'developed nation' by
2041. 
Bangladesh's economic success has not gone unnoticed on the global stage. The country's
consistent GDP growth has led to its classification as a 'Next Eleven' (N-11) economy, a
group of nations expected to play a significant role in the 21st-century global economy. This
potential economic growth is why USA, China, Russia, Japan, India and the rest of the world
are paying attention towards Bangladesh. 
Regarding BCIM (Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar) economic corridor, Bangladesh is
pivotal in facilitating road, rail, and maritime connectivity within these four countries.
Indian critics of BCIM state that China cannot be trusted due to its claim on Arunachal
Pradesh, and here, BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal), another economic corridor,
may boost regional cooperation and security in this region. BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/bangladeshs-ascent-as-a-middle-power-a-shift-in-geopolitical-landscape 1/6Here, Bangladesh is one of the potential factors for China and India in this region to
determine who will establish supremacy. Moreover, China has invested almost $30 billion in
Bangladesh's infrastructure, with projects like the Padma Bridge Rail link, Karnaphuli River
Tunnel, the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, and many more. These investments are part of
China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and aim to enhance connectivity between China,
Bangladesh, and beyond. 
China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a strategy that seeks to connect Asia with Africa and
Europe through land and maritime networks to improve regional integration, increase
trade, and stimulate economic growth. Bangladesh has joined China's BRI initiatives, and
China sees Bangladesh as an 'all weather friendship' and one of their 'strategic partners.'
To counter Chinese influence in this region, the United States of America also announced
their 'Indo-Pacific Strategy' that emphasises America's vision for a free, open, connected,
prosperous, resilient, and secure Indo-Pacific region. 
On April 2023, Bangladesh formally announced its 'Indo-Pacific Outlook' (IPO) to the world,
emphasising its principle of foreign policy (Article 25 of the constitution), especially
'friendship to all, malice to none.' 
The objectives include strengthening partnerships, promoting dialogue, maintaining
maritime safety and security, combating transnational organised crime and sustainable
development, building resilient value chains, and enhancing health security in these Indo-
Pacific regions. It is also mentioned in the outlook that Bangladesh will uphold the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which establishes the rights and
responsibilities of United Nations Member States when using the world's oceans.
The bargaining position and competition between America and China have developed in
this region, centring Bangladesh, especially regarding the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh's
strategic location on the Bay of Bengal makes it a crucial node in China's BRI, which seeks
to connect China to the Indian Ocean region and beyond. Bangladesh's geographic position
offers a vital route for China's trade and energy corridors, reducing its dependence on the
Malacca Strait. 
On the other hand, Bangladesh's location in the Bay of Bengal is significant for America's
Indo-Pacific strategy, which emphasises maintaining maritime security, freedom of
navigation, and regional stability. 
Bangladesh's engagement with both China's BRI and America's Indo-Pacific strategy
involves careful diplomatic balancing. While it seeks economic benefits and infrastructure
development from China, it also values its strategic and security relationships with the
United States. 
Russia and China have similar objectives in the Bay of Bengal to reduce the influence of
America and its allies through military cooperation, economic cooperation, diplomacy, etc.
Against them, India, Japan and the United States of America share a similar interest in this
region. 
If Bangladesh gives a special facility to any country in the Bay of Bengal, it can be a 'game
changer' in regional politics that will have severe global implications for superpowers
regarding power politics.
The recent visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to Bangladesh can be seen to
consolidate one of his country's Indo-Pacific strategies. Russian foreign minister Lavrov's
visit to Bangladesh comes at a time when there is an invisible battle between the
superpowers about the Indo-Pacific strategy. All these create immense competition
between the USA along with its Western allies and Sino-Russian blocks. From their visits to
Bangladesh, it is evident that not only regionally but also globally, Bangladesh is now an
emerging middle power that got enormous attraction from superpowers.
The recent BRICS and G-20 summits are also significant for Bangladesh. Although
Bangladesh could not become a member of BRICS this time, Bangladesh is a member of25/05/2025, 11:49 Bangladesh's ascent as a middle power: A shift in geopolitical landscape | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/bangladeshs-ascent-as-a-middle-power-a-shift-in-geopolitical-landscape 2/6NDB (New Development Bank) under BRICS, and Bangladesh will undoubtedly be the most
promising country at the next conference of BRICS. 
Though, the IMF and World Bank have given loans to Bangladesh, and if they fail to give
loans again, then it will not be wrong to ask this New Development Bank to work in favour
of Bangladesh on behalf of Global South. 
At the G-20 summit, addressing 'One Earth,' the Prime Minister of Bangladesh stressed
strengthening global solidarity and making concerted efforts to tackle the global crisis,
giving a four-point recommendation. She emphasised that to establish peace and harmony
throughout the world, developed nations with major economies must come forward for the
sake of humanity. 
Regarding climate-induced migration, she urged all to operationalise the Loss and Damage
Fund as early as possible to create additional financing mechanisms and emphasised that
in the upcoming COP-28, every country should implement this fund with accountability and
transparency. She also emphasised the repatriation of Rohingya and the international
community's support regarding this. 
Another achievement is the Padma Bridge and Link Road project. Being part of the Asian
highway route AH-1 will create several opportunities with proper use. It will revolutionise
the communication of South Asian countries, including the internal communication of
Bangladesh. The southern part of the country will be connected with the Trans-Asian
Highway and Trans-Asian Railway. Establishing direct communication with India, Bhutan,
and Nepal will be possible. 
Passenger and goods transportation will be facilitated. Padma Bridge will be one of the
focal points of the Asian Highway as it will connect 32 countries with Route 1. 
When the train goes from Singapore to Europe on the Trans Asian Network, it will travel at
160 km/h via the Padma Bridge. However, a 17 km rail bridge has to be constructed over
Buriganga-Dhaleswari. Once this is done, the Padma Bridge will be connected to the Trans
Asian Rail. 
All these have turned Bangladesh into one of the emerging middle powers, and it will not
be wrong to say that soon Bangladesh will become one of the prominent business hubs for
Europe, America, Russia and India.
Bangladesh's relevance to superpowers lies in its economic potential, regional significance,
extraction of natural resources and contributions to global challenges. The evolving
dynamics in South Asia and the broader global context make Bangladesh's role and
relevance increasingly significant in the 21st century.

Tuesday.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) released the 20-point document titled 'Joint
Statement on Deepening the Closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation
between Bangladesh and China' yesterday before Sheikh Hasina's departure for
home concluding her six-day official visit to China.

Beijing will push for initiatives with strategic interests in Bangladesh and the Bay
of Bengal, while Dhaka will focus on trade and economy as Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina meets Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang today.
Xi Jinping and Sheikh Hasina
The joint statement that will come out following the meetings at the Great Hall of
the People will lay the vision for the future relationship, which is now a ""strategic
partnership of cooperation"".
Foreign policy analysts view the three-day visit to Beijing, which comes 16 days
after the state visit to New Delhi, as a balancing act by Hasina, who hopes to be in
the good books of the two competing regional powers as they jostle for influence
in South Asia as well as in the Bay of Bengal region.
""Balancing [relations with] the two Asian competitors is very crucial for
Bangladesh, but it will not be easy,"" said Sk Tawfique M Haque, director of the
South Asian Institute of Policy Governance at North South University.
China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade between the two
nations exceeding $25 billion. However, exports from Bangladesh account for less
than 3 percent of the sum.
Narrowing the trade gap will be a major focus of this trip.
""We would explore all ways of minimising this gap,"" Foreign Minister Hasan
Mahmud told reporters on July 7.

Together we can achieve great things: PM  at trade sum m it
in China
The two countries are expected to sign 20-22 memoranda of understanding
(MoUs) in the areas of trade and investment, digital economy, banking,
infrastructure development, disaster management, agriculture and people-to-
people connectivity. Yesterday, as many as 18 MoUs were signed.
However, hopes of getting a $5 billion loan in yuan were dashed after Dhaka and
Beijing failed to agree on the terms and conditions of interest and grace period of
the loan, officials said.
""China will not provide the loan without conditions. Even if they provide the loan
and other assistance, it will be a way for China to keep Bangladesh on its fold,""
said Tawfique, dean of NSU's School of Humanities and Social Sciences.
The Western powers will not be happy if such a currency swap happens between
Bangladesh and China because this will be part of the de-dollarisation movement
that China and Russia really want, especially after the Ukraine war, he added.
Bangladesh will seek Chinese support for the Southern Integrated Development
Initiative (SIDI) centring the Payra Port in Patuakhali, Mahmud said.
Japan is supporting the Moheshkhali-Matarbari Integrated Infrastructure
Development Initiative (MIDI) and the BIG-B Initiative (The Bay of Bengal
Industrial Growth Belt). ""Similarly, Dhaka wants Beijing to support SIDI,"" said a
foreign ministry official informed with the proceedings.
On July 4, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China stands
ready to work with Bangladesh to carry forward the spirit of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence.
China wants to ""deepen political mutual trust, further synergise development
strategies, advance high-quality Belt and Road (BRI) cooperation, speed up
implementing the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security
Initiative (GSI) and the Global Civilisation Initiative, and elevate the bilateral
relations to a new level"", she said.
Bangladesh joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative when Xi Jinping
visited Dhaka in 2016. Beijing wants Dhaka to join GDI and GSI too. However,
Bangladesh is taking time before arriving at a decision.
Recently, there has also been a debate surrounding the Teesta project.
Following a proposal from Bangladesh, China showed interest in funding a part of
the $1 billion project in 2021. But the project saw no progress.
India, meanwhile, showed interest, and Hasan Mahmud said Dhaka would
consider India's proposal first as it is a common river between the two countries.
China also wants to improve its political relationship with the Awami League and
a delegation will be visiting China for signing an MoU in the days to come.
The objective of improving political relationships is to better implement the
Chinese agenda in Bangladesh, said Imtiaz Ahmed, executive director of the
Centre for Alternatives.
""China will work with whichever political party is in power. This is the Chinese
approach. If the party in power [in Bangladesh] is strong in safeguarding national
interest, there is no problem at all,"" Imtiaz said.
There is a competition between China and India over Mongla Port in Bagerhat,
and it may be an issue in the coming days, according to people with knowledge of
the talks.
""Bangladesh remains on the back foot because of its governance challenges.
Therefore, the balancing act has become difficult for Bangladesh. We, therefore,
should improve our financial governance and political consensus on foreign
affairs before we fall into further trouble,"" Tawfique of NSU said.

China relations were now at a new historical turning point and heading towards a promising
future. “China-Bangladesh cooperation will deliver more fruits for the people of the two
countries, and will contribute to peace and stability and development in the region,” he said. Xi
said they had agreed to elevate China-Bangladesh relationship from a ‘Closer Comprehensive
Partnership of Cooperation’ to a ‘Strategic Partnership of Cooperation.’ Both sides also agreed to
increase high-level exchanges and strategic communication so that bilateral relations move ahead
at even a higher level, he said. Terming his meeting with Prime Minister Hasina ‘warm and
productive,’ the Chinese president said they reached agreements on a number of important issues.
“We have agreed to jointly advance the road and belt initiative,” Xi said, adding that they had
also agreed to launch a joint feasibility study on China-Bangladesh Free Trade Agreement to
strengthen trade and investment cooperation. The Chinese president laid emphasis on enhancing
practical cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure, production capacity, energy and power,
transportation, ICT and agriculture. He said China would continue to do its best in providing
capital, technical and human resources to carry out close cooperation on projects to support
economic and social development of Bangladesh. The two countries also agreed to designate the
year 2017 as the year of ‘exchange and friendship’ between Bangladesh and China during which
colorful events will be held to carry forward the friendship. They also laid emphasis on
institutionalising cooperation on maritime affairs, counter-terrorism, advance the BCIM
Economic Corridor and increase communication and coordination on international and regional
issues. “China is ready to work with Bangladesh as friends and partners with trust and support to
each other,” said the Chinese president. Prime Minister Hasina said: “Today, we have elevated
our ‘Closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation’ to a ‘Strategic Partnership for
Cooperation’ and under this strategic partnership, we have agreed to work towards socio-
economic advancement of the peoples of our two countries.” She said they reached a consensus
on cooperation in key areas such as trade and investment, infrastructure, industry, power, and
energy, information and communication technology and agriculture. They witnessed the signing
of 27 agreements and MoUs of cooperation that cover, among others, trade, investment, blue
economy, BCIM-EC, roads, and bridges, railways, power, maritime, ICT, Industrial production,
capacity building and skill development. Both leaders also unveiled the plaques of six projects
adding that the signing of these instruments and the unveiling of these plaques created a platform
for the two countries to cooperate at a higher plane. The prime minister said her government’s
efforts today were aimed at attaining the goals of becoming a knowledge-based middle-income
country by 2021 and eventually a developed country by 2041. She also said that they had very
fruitful discussions on bilateral, regional and international issues of common interest. “We have
reiterated our commitment to support the ‘One China Policy.’ We have agreed to work closely
and support each other on regional and international issues of mutual interest.” Elaborating on the

said the two countries would now work together to fight terrorism and militancy, particularly by
capacity building and exchange of information and good practices. “A MoU on the issue has been
signed after the talks,” he said.mDuring the talks, Shahidul said, the Chinese side hinted at
making special investment in RMG and jute sectors. As part of a consensus on enhanced
economic cooperation, the two countries inked a framework agreement on production capacity
building after the talks, the foreign secretary said, adding that under the deal, the Chinese
government would assist Bangladesh in technology transfer, capacity building, training and
establishment of new entities. He said China would make an investment involving a huge amount
in the ICT sector in Bangladesh to help materialise its vision of building Digital Bangladesh.
Haque said during the talks the Chinese president highly appreciated Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina’s leadership and Bangladesh’s stunning achievement in different sectors under her able
stewardship. The foreign secretary said the two leaders pledged to work together to implement
the sustainable development goals. Maritime was a new area where the two countries agreed for
collaboration and the two countries signed a MoU for cooperation on blue economy. Shahidul
said the foreign ministers of the two countries signed another MoU to support the ‘One Belt One
Road’, a connectivity initiative of the Chinese president. The foreign secretary said several other
MoUs were signed in the private sector and that these would strengthen ties between the two
nation’s private sectors particularly in the areas of trade and investment. Asked about the
estimated financial value of the agreements and MoUs, he said: “You will have to wait a few days
to know about the total financial involvement of the projects.” But he said the two leaders agreed
that the development of the people of the two countries was most crucial for bilateral ties.
Without any elaboration, the foreign secretary said an agreement was signed on economic and
technical cooperation and a framework agreement on road and tunnel. President Xi led a 13-
member high powered Chinese delegation at the talks. They included two senior members of
Politburo of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China Wang Huning and Li Zhanshu,
State Councilor Yang Jiechi, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Minister of National Development and
Reform Commission Xu Shaoshi, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei, Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng
and Governor of the People’s Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina led
the Bangladesh side that comprised of Finance Minister AMA Muhith, Industries Minister Amir
Hossain Amu, Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed, Public Administration Minister Syed Ashraful
Islam, Minister for Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader, Foreign Minister AH Mahmood
Ali and Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal. Upon his arrival at the Prime Minister’s Office
around 3pm, Sheikh Hasina received Xi at the Tiger Gate of the PMO and then the two leaders
held a tête-à-tête for about ten minutes. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Dhaka this
morning on a historic state visit amid high hopes in Bangladesh that it will be the beginning of a
historic new journey towards opening up a new horizon in bilateral relations.

ʻBangladesh can’t wait forever to resolve
the Teesta issue’
Mon Sep 5, 2022 07:41 PM
Last update on: Tue Sep 6, 2022 04:17 PM
Dr Im tiaz Ahmed, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, talks
about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ongoing visit to India and what to expect in
the future of Bangladesh-India relations in an interview with Shuprova
Tasneem of The Daily Star.
Will importing fuel from Russia be a major talking point during the prime
minister's trip, and can that affect our relationship with other nations?িতা  িনেয়  খালাখুিল  আেলাচনা  হওয়া  উিচত িতা  িনেয়  খালাখুিল  আেলাচনা  হওয়া  উিচত
In light of the Covid pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, there will definitely
be a focus on energy security. India still has a relationship with Russia and has
not looked into sanctions the way the West wanted. Bangladesh would definitely
want to learn how we can benefit from this relationship.
At the same time, one should know that any energy insecurity in Bangladesh
would also become a problem for the West. Our main export markets for ready-
made garment (RMG) products are in the US and Europe. If we suffer from energy
insecurity and it costs us more to produce RMG products, it will also increase
their costs and reduce their profit margins. So I believe it will be a win-win
situation for all if we can resolve our energy problems, either through a good
relationship with Russia by purchasing directly, or through help from India,
particularly when it comes to payment and other mechanisms.
How important is Bangladesh in India's Look East Policy, especially given
India's current relationship with China?
The importance depends on how much honey there is in the pot. If there is more
instability and less economic development, this interest will fizzle out. Ultimately,
geopolitics does not create human beings – it's human beings who create
geopolitics. Bangladesh's growth momentum over the last 15-20 years, despite the
obstacles faced, is what makes other countries interested in us, including India.
Bangladesh has by now managed to convince the world that what we are
interested in is economic development. It comes from our long-cherished goal of
becoming a peaceful country – a goal that was set by the father of the nation. So
whether we have ties with India, China, Japan, the US or Russia – all of it is based
on an economic relationship, not security or military development. At the same
time, Bangladesh guarantees that we would not allow anyone to use our territory
against anyone else. That's what leads to favourable ties with Dhaka regardless of
who is in power in India, because the current regime has made good on this
promise, especially in terms of dealing with insurgency coming from the
northeast. So I don't think Delhi or Beijing have any worries over Bangladesh's ties
with others, since a military alliance is never on the cards.

PM Hasina’s India visit: Will our expectations be met?
There are some concerns that Bangladesh is too dependent on trade with India
when it comes to essential goods. What is your view on this?
No country would want to be dependent on one source. We've had hiccups in this
regard, especially in terms of onion import, which forced us to look to Egypt and
Pakistan. We have already opened a channel with Russia for wheat, so I don't
think this is really an issue. The problem is that whenever we discuss trade or
connectivity, we fall back on traditional linkages and use a piecemeal approach.
Political will is required to look at the bigger picture. To this date, we have not
been able to mainstream technology and talk about creating new structures. For
example, we are currently discussing updating railway structures from the British
era. But with the existing technology, it's not difficult to think of a high-speed
train between Dhaka and Delhi. There are countries that have changed their
entire geographical composition like this, such as China. So why are we not
thinking about this?
The first thing that needs to change is our mindset. We are very conservative
when it comes to planning and investing in long-term projects. The fact that India
spends huge resources on the conflict with Pakistan could be part of this. There
are an estimated half a million troops in Kashmir alone, it's unthinkable. But
beyond the funding, there is also a lack of imagination. Technology has given us
the opportunity to not be slaves to geography, and we should take advantage of
that. The possibilities in this region are immense.
While there are talks of other water-sharing treaties, we are still no closer to a
resolution on the Teesta.
I can't speak for the policymakers, but it's possible they think that if we go
forward with other water-sharing agreements, we can tone down the issue of
Teesta and return to it later. But if we fail to resolve the Teesta issue and go ahead
with other agreements, then there will of course be criticism, and the
government will have to deal with that. One estimate suggests that the livelihoods
of 20 million people are impacted by the Teesta River. If we keep their concerns
hanging for so long, despite there even being a draft agreement, and move on to
other rivers that don't impact as many people, it will definitely become a political
and a partisan issue.
So why is the Teesta issue not being resolved? We need to have frank discussions
with Delhi on the factor that is Sikkim. There are 30-32 small and big dams for
hydroelectric power that are estimated to be affecting around five percent of
water flow in each of the dams, according to one eminent Indian hydrologist,
leading to a lean seasonal flow draining into Bangladesh. Mamata Banerjee's
contention around Teesta is all about this – not considering Sikkim in the
calculations.
Will they deconstruct the dams? Of course not. But Bangladesh can try to solve
this by storing rain/floodwater from the rainy season and letting it flow during
winter. There are environmental and monetary costs: one calculation suggests it
will be around USD 1 billion. Although China showed some interest, India
immediately became fearful of it. One way to resolve this is by creating a
consortium where different stakeholders can provide the funding and expertise
for this infrastructure. India must accept that Bangladesh will not wait forever to
resolve this issue.

Understanding the proposed Bangladesh-India
Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)
Will Myanmar an d the Rohingya refugees be a part of the discussions in Delhi?
Definitely. The point that some of us are also raising is, now that there are talks
about a tripartite engagement on the Rohingyas between China, Myanmar and
Bangladesh, why can't Delhi organise the same? That is something I think our
prime minister would flag this time, especially since we have not seen much
progress on this issue. Given that India has good relationships with both
Bangladesh and Myanmar, it can play a critical role. Take, for example, Turkey's
involvement in talks between Russia and Ukraine to open a Black Sea corridor for
the export of grains, which helped it become one of the big players when it comes
to negotiations in this conflict. Playing a similar role in the Rohingya issue could
also boost India's global status. This is especially pertinent now after the two ICJ
judgments recognising the ""Rohingya"" identity and the US calling the Myanmar
military actions against the Rohingyas a ""genocide.""
Why have we stopped talking about border killings?
This is very unfortunate. If a smuggler is not armed, you can arrest him, but
killing him is not permitted under the Indian Constitution or the international
law. And then there are the killings of civilians like 15-year-old Felani Khatun.
Yet, during the Galwan dispute on the India-China border, not a single shot was
fired. Why is that? Because of a 1996 agreement between China and India that
stipulates no-one can carry firearms for two kilometres on each side of the
border. So if this can be done there, why can't it be done on our borders?

https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/siz624stg2 1/3China's ambassador to Bangladesh, Li Jiming, said that Bangladesh offered its helping
hand to China during the early days of the Covid outbreak. After the situation in China
improved, China in turn offered their helping hand to Bangladesh.
During those challenging times, important strides were made in the relations between the
two countries, he added.
Ambassador Li Jiming made these remarks at the Prothom Alo office on Sunday.
The outgoing ambassador came to visit the Prothom Alo office in the afternoon. He was
received by the editor of Prothom Alo, Matiur Rahman. They held a meeting to exchange
views.
After the meeting, Li Jiming spoke in an interview with Prothom Alo about bilateral
relations, cooperation and more.
After his stint of more than three years in Bangladesh, Li Jiming will be leaving Dhaka in
the second week of December.
When asked about how relations had been during his term as ambassador, he said he had
felt very honoured to be the ambassador of China to Bangladesh, shouldering the mission
for the President of China, President Xi Jingping to uplift the strategic partnership of
cooperation between China and Bangladesh to a higher level.
Li Jiming further said there had been significant progress and bilateral relationship has
been strengthened in many ways, especially during the pandemic.
He said Bangladesh was the first country to jump on board the Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) in South Asia and sign the MOU in this regard. Over the past three years, BRI has had
a lot of achievements, he said, pointing to the examples of Payra power plant, the
Karnaphuli Tunnel and the Dasherkandi Sewerage Treatment Plant.I estimate that the trade volume between the two countries
will exceed US$ 28 billion this year. That is a historic
record high in Bangladesh-China bilateral trade

Ambassador Li Jiming said, adding that the most significant progress has been achieved
during these three years.
""I estimate that the trade volume between the two countries will exceed US$ 28 billion
this year. That is a historic record high in Bangladesh-China bilateral trade,"" he added.
As far as Bangladesh's media is concerned, Li Jiming said Prothom Alo is the most
prominent one and his colleagues had always spoken highly about this paper, adding that
this is not just a newspaper, but much more.
""The Bangladesh media is very dynamic and pro-active. The professionalism of the media
is impressive,"" Li Jiming said.
However, he felt that Bangladesh's media relied on sources from the West rather than
original ones. For example, he said, the media used western sources only when reporting
on the Ukraine crisis or the issue of Uyghur's Muslims in China. But in general,
Bangladesh's media is very friendly towards China, Li Jiming said.25/05/2025, 10:11 ‘Important strides made in Bangladesh-China relations during pandemic’

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/361833/bangladesh-seeks-more-defence-cooperation-from 1/3Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain has sought more defence sector cooperation from
Beijing, saying Chinese training has increased Bangladesh's UN peacekeeping capabilities.
""We have very important defence cooperation between China and Bangladesh. China is a major
supplier of our defence equipment. And the modernization of our military services that we are
looking forward to, I think we need a lot of cooperation in this respect from China,"" he said while
speaking at a seminar on Bangladesh-China relations Monday.
Another area he mentioned is cooperation in personnel training.
""We have very deep defence training cooperation and this needs to continue and be enhanced, if
possible,"" the adviser said, adding: ""Cooperation with China also increased our capability in
participation in UN peacekeeping operations which are important for our country.""
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen and experts from both sides spoke at the seminar
organized by the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) in
collaboration with the Centre for China Studies, DU.
The foreign adviser said that it is likely that the post-revolution trajectory of Bangladesh and its
future relations with China might be influenced by various factors, including Bangladesh's
political stability as well as the changing dynamics of regional and global politics.
Rohingya crisis
The adviser also sought China's support for resolving the Rohingya crisis. He particularly
mentioned Chinese influence in Myanmar while seeking Beijing's ""active role"" in this regard.
""We know China has been cooperating with us for their return. The only solution to the problem
is their return to their homeland. There is also a tripartite mechanism. We all know China has a lot
of influence in Myanmar. Let us accept the realities. We look forward to China's more active role
in their return,"" he said.

With the guidance of the Belt and Road Initiative, China-Bangladesh relations will
surely reach a new height and open a new era of friendly cooperation, Chinese
Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen has said.

""The Belt and Road Initiative has no gene of seeking hegemony, no tradition of
interfering in other country's internal affairs, and no elements of expansion and
plunder,"" he said.
Yao Wen was addressing a report launching event at a city hotel yesterday
evening, marking the 10th anniversary of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
""It can be said that on the journey of Bangladesh's modernisation, the Belt and
Road Initiative is most consistent with the 'Vision 2041' and 'Sonar Bangla' dream
and is most suitable for Bangladesh's reality,"" he added.
Bangladesh is the first country in South Asia to join the BRI, a China-led global
initiative to connect Asia, Europe and Africa. It was launched in 2013.
The core spirit of the ancient Silk Road is peace and cooperation, openness and
inclusiveness, learning from each other and mutual benefit. This spirit is a vivid
image of China's fine traditional culture, and it is also the core essence of today's
Belt and Road Initiative, Yao Wen said.
Over the past decade, it has attracted the participation of more than three-
quarters of countries and 32 international organisations worldwide, generated
nearly 1 trillion US dollars of investment, formed more than 3,000 cooperation
projects, and lifted about 40 million people out of poverty.
China has made a commitment of $40 billion for Bangladesh's development under
BRI.
Yao Wen said in the past seven years, the BRI has injected impetus into
Bangladesh's economic growth, and improved the livelihood of Bangladeshi
people.
""Looking ahead, the BRI will continue to unleash strong vitality and become a
road of opportunity and prosperity for China and Bangladesh,"" he said.
Wen said China's BRI can help Bangladesh's real GDP growth by at least 2.1
percent and decrease extreme poverty by 1.3 percent.
The BRI also will generate additional 2.5-5.1 percent employment, he said.
The trade volume between Bangladesh and China has increased from $15.3
billion in 2016 to $27.8 billion in 2022, Wen said.
Also, the Chinese investment to Bangladesh has gone up from $241 million in
2016 to $1.346 billion, he added.
Education Minister Dipu Moni lauded China for the support being extended to
Bangladesh and its people.
""Two countries will work together to push Bangladesh-China relations to a new
height,"" UNB quoted her as saying while speaking as the chief guest at the report
launching programme.
She noted Chinese President Xi Jinping's commitment to stand by Bangladesh in
it's journey towards a developed and smart nation by 2041.

mega projects in Bangladesh, Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Li Jiming has said more Chinese
companies will come to Bangladesh as the country has been a very attractive investment
destination.
“I see Bangladesh-China relationship as good friends, good and trustworthy partners. Partners for
economic development and partners of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),” he told UNB in an
interview.
Ambassador Li Jiming stressed that the BRI programmes will not be affected at all due to the
coronavirus outbreak. 
Responding to a question, Jiming said they are working on ways to ensure smooth
implementation of mega projects undertaken by the Chinese companies.
“I’ve decided to visit some of the key projects, including Padma Bridge Rail Link project, to see
the situation on the ground…,” he said acknowledging that there are some impacts but there will
not be any substantial impact on the mega projects.     
The Ambassador will visit, among others, the main camp of the first division of ‘CREC Project
Management Office of Padma Bridge Rail Link Project (PBRLP) on Wednesday.
Explaining that BRI will not be affected, the Chinese Ambassador said BRI rather helps
overcome the current challenges.
Ambassador Jiming said China, under the BRI mechanism, provided 500 sets of ‘most advanced
kits’, to Bangladesh to identify coronavirus as a gesture of goodwill and strong faith that
Bangladesh has in China in winning the battle against COVID-19.
“Bangladesh was the first country to receive such support,” said the Ambassador saying
everybody gets benefits if China can overcome difficulties.
Expressing satisfaction over the investment climate in Bangladesh, Jiming said there is still room
for further improvement, especially in land acquisition process outside economic zones and
easing some policies.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a development strategy of the Chinese
government aimed at enhancing regional connectivity and cooperation among
the Eurasian countries—primarily the People's Republic of China and the
countries that spread along the historically famous land-based Silk Road
Economic Belt (SREB) and the Maritime Silk Road (MSR).

BRI is designed to address an infrastructure gap along several land corridors of
Asia, Europe and Africa and in maritime countries of Asia, Europe, Africa and
Oceania. The proposed infrastructure development projects including deep
seaports, highways and railways in Bangladesh under BRI for regional
connectivity, should be given utmost importance by the Government of
Bangladesh for modernising and expanding the existing infrastructure facilities
in the country, which have been acting as serious bottlenecks in the way of our
economic development.
Bangladesh became a part of the regional cooperation arrangement known as the
Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM-EC), also known as
the Kunming Initiative, which was vigorously pursued by both India and China
up to 2014. But after the election defeat of the Congress-led coalition government
in India in 2014, the UPA government led by BJP's Narendra Modi virtually
abandoned the BCIM-EC agreement for its changed regional geopolitical strategy,
where India considers China as its foremost regional adversary and superpower
rival. Therefore, India has forged a strong alliance with the USA and Japan to
deny China easy access to the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean.
It is alleged that pressure was exerted on Bangladesh in 2014 to cancel a financing
arrangement with China to build a deep sea port in Sonadia of Cox's Bazar.
Earlier, a feasibility study conducted by a Japanese firm in 2009 recommended to
build the Sonadia Deep Sea Port in phases.
Prime Minister Modi has been propagating a new regional cooperation
arrangement since then styled as BBIN Framework including Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India and Nepal. Needless to say, the BBIN framework will be a very poor
alternative to BCIM-EC. But it seems the BCIM-EC will not be implemented in the
near future. The future of Sonadia Deep Sea Port project is now uncertain. Under
the BCIM-EC arrangement, two projects for building a railway line and a highway
connecting Bangladesh's Ukhia in Cox's Bazar with China's Kunming City and the
Yunan province through Myanmar were taken up for implementation. The
Bangladesh part of the railway line is being constructed, but the Myanmar parts
of both of the railway and highway projects seem to have been abandoned by
Myanmar.
Earlier, China helped Myanmar to build a deep sea port at Sittwe (former Akyab),
capital of Rakhine State, to overcome the problems of its Yangon Port. India has
taken up the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport project linking Mizoram of
India with Sittwe to provide the land-locked ""Seven Sisters"" states of North-east
India a vital ocean link for international trade through the deeply excavated and
broadened Kaladan River. But after its failure to obtain clearance for Sonadia,
China quickly embarked on a new cooperation arrangement with Myanmar for
building another deep sea port and a special economic zone in Kyaukphyu, about
100km south of Sittwe. It should be clear that both China and India are vying for
Myanmar's favour for their own geo-strategic advantages. Obviously, Bangladesh
cannot out-compete Myanmar in this geo-political game because of the latter's
vast natural resources as well as geo-strategic advantages.
Meanwhile, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been given a
contract by Bangladesh to build a deep sea port along with an LNG terminal at
Matarbari of Maheshkhali in Cox's Bazar, not far away from Sonadia. It is claimed
that Matarbari Port will provide about 13 metres of depth for deep-draft ships.
But experts point out that Sonadia has got a gift of nature in the form of a deep
strip of the Bay of Bengal with a natural depth of 15 metres.
Experts advise that Bangladesh should not abandon the idea of building a
genuine deep sea port in Sonadia Island. Now that the geo-political rivalry of the
superpowers has led to the lack of support for the Chinese-funded deep sea port
project, for the time being Bangladesh should start to build the port in phases for
its own use with alternative sources of financing, especially in the context of the
sad reality that Bangladesh's prime sea port at Chattogram has become seriously
handicapped because of a maximum of only 9.1 metres of available draft for
ships.
Chattogram has become a lighterage port where deeper-draft ships and longer
ships are anchored at the outer-anchorage in the Bay. Lighter vessels are used to
lighter the cargo or the containers to the port at considerable cost involving both
money and time. Even the bigger motherships unload their import-cargo or
containers at either Singapore or Colombo to be lightered to Chattogram in
lighter-vessels. Similar lighterage methods are used for some export items from
Bangladesh. A proposed ""Bay Terminal"" at Patenga coast with a maximum
available draft of 12 metres for ships may be able to handle longer ships with
deeper draft, but that will not meet the urgent need for a genuine deep sea port
for the rapidly growing economy of Bangladesh.
The reality is that Bangladesh cannot antagonise its regional superpower
neighbour India, which surrounds Bangladesh from three sides. Bangladesh has a
very delicate balancing act at hand in pursuing the opportunities offered by
China's BRI projects. Bangladesh officially became a participant of BRI in 2016,
when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Bangladesh, through signing a number
of projects worth USD 21.5 billion. But we have to make judicious feasibility study
of plans before accepting Chinese credit for infrastructure projects. We should
also carefully study the terms and conditions of the loans to avoid the alleged
""debt traps"" created in different countries like Sri Lanka, Maldives and Pakistan.

Last update on: Wed Jan 1, 2025 07:43 PM
As the new year begins, everything takes on a new look. In the year 2025, the
China-Bangladesh relationship will usher in its 50th year of dynamic
development. At the start of the new year, I would like to extend my New Year
greetings and best wishes to all the people of Bangladesh. I wish the nation of
Bangladesh prosperity and stability, and the people happiness and health.

How will Bangladesh-China relations shape up?
In 2024, the world witnessed further transformation and instability, marked by
protracted and intensified geopolitical conflicts, repeated attempts to decouple
and sever supply chains, and the rapid rise of the Global South. It has become all
the more clear where the once-in-a-century transformations are heading. In 2024,
China acted on the blueprint drawn up at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and made big strides in
comprehensively deepening reform. Marking the 75th anniversary of its
founding, China carried forward its great cause of national development and
pressed ahead with Chinese modernisation with vigour and determination. In
2024, facing a critical juncture in history, we upheld fundamental principles
while breaking new ground in diplomacy, and we responded to a fast-changing
landscape with composure and confidence. Our diplomatic efforts have helped
foster a favourable external environment for China's high-quality development
and provided much-needed stability to a turbulent world.
China has always been an important member of the Global South. We have been
committed to promoting unity and revitalisation of the Global South, promoting
the cause of global development, and ensuring no country is left behind on the
path to modernisation. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive
Global South cooperation and announced eight measures in support of Global
South cooperation. We have made substantive progress in promoting high-quality
Belt and Road cooperation in light of the urgent needs of many countries. With
155 countries joining the big family of Belt and Road cooperation, this road to
happiness is growing ever broader. Given the widening development deficit,
President Xi Jinping announced at the G20 Summit China's eight actions to
support global development, which include strengthening cooperation with other
countries in key areas such as poverty reduction, food security, and scientific and
technological innovation.
Over the past year, a remarkable new chapter has been written in head-of-state
diplomacy, which has steered the trend of the times toward peace, development,
and win-win cooperation. Breakthroughs have been made in building a
community with a shared future for mankind, which has shaped the historical
trend toward a shared future and greater solidarity in our global village. We have
provided new opportunities for the world with Chinese modernisation, which has
promoted the development trend of modernisation in countries around the
world. China's cooperation with other developing countries has set a fine
example, which has reinforced the trend of uniting for strength within the Global
South. China has made new progress in pursuing all-round diplomacy, which has
built up the trend toward a new type of international relations.
Facing the future, China will continue to bear in mind the larger picture,
shoulder responsibilities for the greater good, and advance the right and just
cause. We will continue to hold high the banner of peace, development,
cooperation, and mutual benefit, and do our best to promote world peace,
tranquillity, and the common progress of humanity.
HE Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, points out that
China and Bangladesh are friendly neighbours who know each other well. Since
the establishment of diplomatic ties, the two countries have always respected and
supported each other, treated each other as equals, and cooperated for win-win
results, setting an example of friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial
cooperation between countries, especially among Global South countries.
Honourable Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus said that Bangladesh and he
himself have forged long-standing friendly ties with China. This year, under the
guidance of the top leadership of the two sides, and with the firm support of the
two peoples, China-Bangladesh relations have continued to develop, and the
profound friendship between the peoples has grown even stronger. This year, the
China-Bangladesh relationship withstood the test of drastic political changes in
Bangladesh, maintained the momentum of development, and demonstrated great
resilience and vitality.
Mutual respect and trust are the solid foundation of the China-Bangladesh
relationship. As the Bangladeshi proverb says, ""Friendship is not a rope, but a
bond of hearts,"" true friendship is not based on external constraints, but on an
inner connection. China has always supported Bangladesh in pursuing an
independent foreign policy, following a path of development in line with its
national conditions, safeguarding national sovereignty, independence, and
territorial integrity, and opposing any external interference. China respects the
development path independently chosen by the Bangladeshi people and pursues
a policy of friendship and good neighbourliness towards all Bangladeshi people.
No matter how the domestic situation in Bangladesh may evolve, the core of the
China-Bangladesh relationship, which is based on mutual respect, equality, and
mutual benefit, will not change; the foundation of friendship between the two
peoples will not change; and the determination of the two governments and
people of all sectors in the two countries to support and promote the
development of bilateral relations will not change. China sincerely hopes that,
under the guidance of the interim government led by Honourable Chief Adviser
Prof Muhammad Yunus, the reforms will proceed, the political situation will
stabilise, the economy will flourish, and people's livelihoods will continue to
improve.
Mutual benefit is the strong driving force for the China-Bangladesh relationship.
China is the largest trading partner of Bangladesh. The China-Bangladesh
relationship has been elevated to a new historical height of comprehensive
strategic cooperative partnership. Under the new circumstances, jointly
advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation is even more opportune, and
the room for further developing the comprehensive strategic cooperative
partnership is even broader. Since the establishment of the interim government,
12 Chinese enterprises have invested a total of $210 million in Bangladesh. China
will provide 1 billion yuan of grants to Bangladesh for livelihood projects agreed
upon by both sides. The total amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) to
Bangladesh declined by 8.8 percent, but the FDI from China experienced a
remarkable threefold increase compared to the previous fiscal year. China has
pledged further expansion of its opening up to Bangladesh and will continue to
provide Bangladesh with zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent of its taxable items
before it graduates from the category of least developed countries. China will
import fresh mangoes from Bangladesh and vigorously engage in practical
cooperation with Bangladesh in the fields of photovoltaics, agriculture, low-
carbon development, and so forth. These pragmatic initiatives fully reflect the
firm support of the Chinese government for the Bangladesh interim government,
and will certainly contribute to the economic and social development of the
country and benefit the people of the two countries.
Mutual assistance is the warm bond of the China-Bangladesh relationship. At the
request of the interim government, China dispatched a National Emergency
Medical Rescue Team to Bangladesh to provide humanitarian and emergency
assistance to those injured during the July-August movement. It was the first
medical rescue team dispatched by a foreign government since the formation of
the interim government. When Bangladesh was struggling against floods and
dengue fever, China was the first to lend a helping hand by visiting the affected
areas and providing Bangladesh with life-saving equipment and facilities in
response to the floods. At present, direct flights between the two capitals have
been launched and operated, with as many as 58 flights per week between the two
countries, which can accommodate more than 11,000 passengers. The flights
substantially facilitated the exchange of personnel between both sides. Currently,
there are nearly 15,000 Bangladeshi students studying in China, building a solid
bridge for cultural and academic exchanges between the two countries. Teachers
at the two Confucius Institutes and one Confucius Classroom in Bangladesh have
taught nearly 3,000 students in the past year. This has further strengthened
people-to-people exchanges, laying the foundation for the friendly relations
between the two countries.
The year 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the China-
Bangladesh diplomatic relationship and the China-Bangladesh Year of People-to-
People Exchanges. China will work together with Bangladesh and stay committed
to the principles of mutual respect, mutual support, equality, and win-win
cooperation. China stands ready to work with Bangladesh to support each other
on issues concerning core interests such as sovereignty, security, and
development, to strengthen cooperation and collaboration under the United
Nations and other multilateral institutions, advocate the common values of
humanity, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for
mankind.
China will continue to maintain high-level exchanges and friendly cooperation
between political parties, strengthen coordination of policies and synergy
between development strategies, carry out more exchanges of experience on
governance, and optimise cooperation mechanisms at all levels and in all fields.
China supports Bangladesh in becoming a BRICS partner country and playing a
more active role in regional organisations such as the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral
Technical and Economic Cooperation. We will also continue efforts for the
political settlement of the Rohingya crisis.

Opening up brings progress, cooperation benefits all
China will continue to work with Bangladesh on the path to modernisation,
promote the implementation of the eight major steps to support high-quality Belt
and Road cooperation, and carry out the construction of major landmark projects
and ""small and beautiful"" livelihood programmes. China will also strengthen
cooperation with Bangladesh in photovoltaics, water resources, poverty
alleviation, green and low-carbon development, and explore specific measures to
promote the implementation of the vision of ""three zeroes."" We will encourage
more Chinese companies to invest in manufacturing industries and promote the
integrated development of the industrial chain and supply chain between the two
countries.
China will continue to enhance friendly cooperation in such fields as culture,
education, tourism, sports, health, youth, women, media, and think tanks. We
will take a series of practical measures to facilitate cross-border travel and form a
new pattern of non-governmental exchanges. By doing so, the friendship between
our two peoples will be further strengthened, bringing more tangible benefits to
the peoples, and making the China-Bangladesh comprehensive strategic
cooperative partnership deeper and more substantive.

theme “Zero Distance to Chinese Language” at its Merul Badda campus in Dhaka on Tuesday.
The Chinese language is one of six official languages of the United Nations which are celebrated
on six separate days for the promotion of multilingualism and cultural diversity.
The UN celebrates Chinese language day on April 20. The celebrations at Brac University were
organized by the Brac Institute of Languages (BIL) while the organizing adviser was the
Embassy of China in Bangladesh.
Speaking as a special guest, Cultural Counselor at the Chinese Embassy Li Shao Feng said:
“Chinese language is not only a means of communication, but every character of this language is
a carrier of civilization.”
“President Xi Jinping has long emphasized the importance of dialogue between civilizations in
building a better world. Through the exchange of language and culture, the friendship between
Bangladesh and China will be elevated to a higher level,” he said.
“I think Brac University will be one of the platforms to elevate Bangladesh and China's
friendship to a higher level,” he added.
Referring to the recent visit of the chief adviser to the interim government to China, Feng said
this year marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Bangladesh, a
year of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.

As the new year begins, everything takes on a new look. In the year 2025, the
China-Bangladesh relationship will usher in its 50th year of dynamic
development. At the start of the new year, I would like to extend my New Year
greetings and best wishes to all the people of Bangladesh. I wish the nation of
Bangladesh prosperity and stability, and the people happiness and health.

How will Bangladesh-China relations shape up?
In 2024, the world witnessed further transformation and instability, marked by
protracted and intensified geopolitical conflicts, repeated attempts to decouple
and sever supply chains, and the rapid rise of the Global South. It has become all
the more clear where the once-in-a-century transformations are heading. In 2024,
China acted on the blueprint drawn up at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and made big strides in
comprehensively deepening reform. Marking the 75th anniversary of its
founding, China carried forward its great cause of national development and
pressed ahead with Chinese modernisation with vigour and determination. In
2024, facing a critical juncture in history, we upheld fundamental principles
while breaking new ground in diplomacy, and we responded to a fast-changing
landscape with composure and confidence. Our diplomatic efforts have helped
foster a favourable external environment for China's high-quality development
and provided much-needed stability to a turbulent world.
China has always been an important member of the Global South. We have been
committed to promoting unity and revitalisation of the Global South, promoting
the cause of global development, and ensuring no country is left behind on the
path to modernisation. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive
Global South cooperation and announced eight measures in support of Global
South cooperation. We have made substantive progress in promoting high-quality
Belt and Road cooperation in light of the urgent needs of many countries. With
155 countries joining the big family of Belt and Road cooperation, this road to
happiness is growing ever broader. Given the widening development deficit,
President Xi Jinping announced at the G20 Summit China's eight actions to
support global development, which include strengthening cooperation with other
countries in key areas such as poverty reduction, food security, and scientific and
technological innovation.
Over the past year, a remarkable new chapter has been written in head-of-state
diplomacy, which has steered the trend of the times toward peace, development,
and win-win cooperation. Breakthroughs have been made in building a
community with a shared future for mankind, which has shaped the historical
trend toward a shared future and greater solidarity in our global village. We have
provided new opportunities for the world with Chinese modernisation, which has
promoted the development trend of modernisation in countries around the
world. China's cooperation with other developing countries has set a fine
example, which has reinforced the trend of uniting for strength within the Global
South. China has made new progress in pursuing all-round diplomacy, which has
built up the trend toward a new type of international relations.
Facing the future, China will continue to bear in mind the larger picture,
shoulder responsibilities for the greater good, and advance the right and just
cause. We will continue to hold high the banner of peace, development,
cooperation, and mutual benefit, and do our best to promote world peace,
tranquillity, and the common progress of humanity.
HE Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, points out that
China and Bangladesh are friendly neighbours who know each other well. Since
the establishment of diplomatic ties, the two countries have always respected and
supported each other, treated each other as equals, and cooperated for win-win
results, setting an example of friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial
cooperation between countries, especially among Global South countries.
Honourable Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus said that Bangladesh and he
himself have forged long-standing friendly ties with China. This year, under the
guidance of the top leadership of the two sides, and with the firm support of the
two peoples, China-Bangladesh relations have continued to develop, and the
profound friendship between the peoples has grown even stronger. This year, the
China-Bangladesh relationship withstood the test of drastic political changes in
Bangladesh, maintained the momentum of development, and demonstrated great
resilience and vitality.
Mutual respect and trust are the solid foundation of the China-Bangladesh
relationship. As the Bangladeshi proverb says, ""Friendship is not a rope, but a
bond of hearts,"" true friendship is not based on external constraints, but on an
inner connection. China has always supported Bangladesh in pursuing an
independent foreign policy, following a path of development in line with its
national conditions, safeguarding national sovereignty, independence, and
territorial integrity, and opposing any external interference. China respects the
development path independently chosen by the Bangladeshi people and pursues
a policy of friendship and good neighbourliness towards all Bangladeshi people.
No matter how the domestic situation in Bangladesh may evolve, the core of the
China-Bangladesh relationship, which is based on mutual respect, equality, and
mutual benefit, will not change; the foundation of friendship between the two
peoples will not change; and the determination of the two governments and
people of all sectors in the two countries to support and promote the
development of bilateral relations will not change. China sincerely hopes that,
under the guidance of the interim government led by Honourable Chief Adviser
Prof Muhammad Yunus, the reforms will proceed, the political situation will
stabilise, the economy will flourish, and people's livelihoods will continue to
improve.
Mutual benefit is the strong driving force for the China-Bangladesh relationship.
China is the largest trading partner of Bangladesh. The China-Bangladesh
relationship has been elevated to a new historical height of comprehensive
strategic cooperative partnership. Under the new circumstances, jointly
advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation is even more opportune, and
the room for further developing the comprehensive strategic cooperative
partnership is even broader. Since the establishment of the interim government,
12 Chinese enterprises have invested a total of $210 million in Bangladesh. China
will provide 1 billion yuan of grants to Bangladesh for livelihood projects agreed
upon by both sides. The total amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) to
Bangladesh declined by 8.8 percent, but the FDI from China experienced a
remarkable threefold increase compared to the previous fiscal year. China has
pledged further expansion of its opening up to Bangladesh and will continue to
provide Bangladesh with zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent of its taxable items
before it graduates from the category of least developed countries. China will
import fresh mangoes from Bangladesh and vigorously engage in practical
cooperation with Bangladesh in the fields of photovoltaics, agriculture, low-
carbon development, and so forth. These pragmatic initiatives fully reflect the
firm support of the Chinese government for the Bangladesh interim government,
and will certainly contribute to the economic and social development of the
country and benefit the people of the two countries.
Mutual assistance is the warm bond of the China-Bangladesh relationship. At the
request of the interim government, China dispatched a National Emergency
Medical Rescue Team to Bangladesh to provide humanitarian and emergency
assistance to those injured during the July-August movement. It was the first
medical rescue team dispatched by a foreign government since the formation of
the interim government. When Bangladesh was struggling against floods and
dengue fever, China was the first to lend a helping hand by visiting the affected
areas and providing Bangladesh with life-saving equipment and facilities in
response to the floods. At present, direct flights between the two capitals have
been launched and operated, with as many as 58 flights per week between the two
countries, which can accommodate more than 11,000 passengers. The flights
substantially facilitated the exchange of personnel between both sides. Currently,
there are nearly 15,000 Bangladeshi students studying in China, building a solid
bridge for cultural and academic exchanges between the two countries. Teachers
at the two Confucius Institutes and one Confucius Classroom in Bangladesh have
taught nearly 3,000 students in the past year. This has further strengthened
people-to-people exchanges, laying the foundation for the friendly relations
between the two countries.
The year 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the China-
Bangladesh diplomatic relationship and the China-Bangladesh Year of People-to-
People Exchanges. China will work together with Bangladesh and stay committed
to the principles of mutual respect, mutual support, equality, and win-win
cooperation. China stands ready to work with Bangladesh to support each other
on issues concerning core interests such as sovereignty, security, and
development, to strengthen cooperation and collaboration under the United
Nations and other multilateral institutions, advocate the common values of
humanity, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for
mankind.
China will continue to maintain high-level exchanges and friendly cooperation
between political parties, strengthen coordination of policies and synergy
between development strategies, carry out more exchanges of experience on
governance, and optimise cooperation mechanisms at all levels and in all fields.
China supports Bangladesh in becoming a BRICS partner country and playing a
more active role in regional organisations such as the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral
Technical and Economic Cooperation. We will also continue efforts for the
political settlement of the Rohingya crisis.

Opening up brings progress, cooperation benefits all
China will continue to work with Bangladesh on the path to modernisation,
promote the implementation of the eight major steps to support high-quality Belt
and Road cooperation, and carry out the construction of major landmark projects
and ""small and beautiful"" livelihood programmes. China will also strengthen
cooperation with Bangladesh in photovoltaics, water resources, poverty
alleviation, green and low-carbon development, and explore specific measures to
promote the implementation of the vision of ""three zeroes."" We will encourage
more Chinese companies to invest in manufacturing industries and promote the
integrated development of the industrial chain and supply chain between the two
countries.
China will continue to enhance friendly cooperation in such fields as culture,
education, tourism, sports, health, youth, women, media, and think tanks. We
will take a series of practical measures to facilitate cross-border travel and form a
new pattern of non-governmental exchanges. By doing so, the friendship between
our two peoples will be further strengthened, bringing more tangible benefits to
the peoples, and making the China-Bangladesh comprehensive strategic
cooperative partnership deeper and more substantive.
Yao Wen is the Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/south-asia/255693/china-sifts-opportunity-from-ashes-of-us-afghan 1/5China's overtures to the Taliban indicate a bid to extract maximum benefit from the dramatic
collapse of the US project in Afghanistan.
But Beijing will remain watchful of the hardliners now running the show in Kabul, especially as
Afghanistan borders China's eastern Xinjiang province, home to the Muslim-majority Uighurs,
analysts say.
Around a fortnight before the Islamists seized power in a lightning offensive that stunned the
world, Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted a Taliban delegation in Beijing.
And just one day after the Taliban entered Kabul, China said it was ready to deepen ""friendly and
cooperative"" relations with Afghanistan.

While Beijing says it has no desire to direct any future political settlement in Kabul, it appears to
have scented opportunity to press its Belt and Road interests as the US pulls out.
Pragmatism prevails
As power transitions to the Taliban, Beijing has a few key demands, said Hua Po, an independent
political analyst in Beijing. 
""The first is to protect China's investments and ensure security of Chinese nationals,"" he says.
x25/05/2025, 14:41 China sifts opportunity from ashes of US Afghan project
https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/south-asia/255693/china-sifts-opportunity-from-ashes-of-us-afghan 2/5""Second, it is necessary to cut off relations with East Turkestan (Xinjiang) separatists and not let
them return to Xinjiang.""
But pragmatism appears to be prevailing over ideology towards a group whose religious doctrines
have in the past left China queasy.
And the Taliban appear to have understood that if they want good relations with China, they will
have to leave China's Muslims -- whose plight is a rallying cause for Islamists worldwide --
alone.
A Taliban spokesman, Mohammad Naeem, has vowed that ""Afghanistan's soil would not be used
against any country's security.""
In China, state media has buffed up the potential of driving major economic schemes under the
new regime, from the Aynak Copper Mine project -- Afghanistan's largest copper deposit, and the
world's second-largest -- to the northern oil fields of Faryab and Sar-i-pul.
Beijing-backed firms have already pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into rights to mine and
build, but extreme insecurity has iced most of the plans.

Meanwhile, Afghanistan's generous lithium deposits -- the country has been dubbed the 'Saudi
Arabia of lithium' -- have manufacturers of electric vehicles which run on the mineral licking
their lips.
And China is the world’s largest EV maker.
The Taliban, who stand to benefit hugely from building ties with Beijing, ""look forward to
China's participation in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan,"" foreign ministry
spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters on Monday.
""We welcome this,"" she said.
China's embassy in Kabul remains operational, although Beijing began evacuating Chinese
citizens from the country months ago as security deteriorated.
'China knows the history'
Afghanistan has for centuries been a cauldron of big power aspirations in central Asia -- many of
which have eventually run aground. 
x25/05/2025, 14:41 China sifts opportunity from ashes of US Afghan project
https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/south-asia/255693/china-sifts-opportunity-from-ashes-of-us-afghan 3/5While the Taliban are trying to rebrand as a more moderate force than during their first brutal
hard-line incarnation, they remain an unpredictable entity leading a volatile country.
""China knows this history, and they know that this is a government that they are not going to
entirely trust,"" said Raffaello Pantucci, a senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of
International Studies in Singapore who specializes in Afghanistan.
And that makes a hasty investment drive unlikely, he said.

""Why is it suddenly a more attractive prospect now, when you have a less stable situation with a
government that is not immensely reliable?""
""I don't foresee Chinese companies saying, 'let's go and mine some lithium' especially in some
parts of the country that are still very dangerous,"" Pantucci added.
Propaganda win
But where China is reaping the benefits already is on the propaganda front, with Beijing openly
wringing maximum propaganda value from America's spectacular foreign policy failure in
Afghanistan.
Its state media pumped out the images of desperate Afghans flooding Kabul airport in an effort to
flee on Monday as a sign of the chaos prompted by the US retreat.
On Tuesday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua said Washington had left ""an awful mess of
unrest, division and broken families"" in Afghanistan.
""America's strength and role is destruction, not construction.""
State media has peddled the idea that America's rush from Afghanistan reflects its fair-weather
attitude to all allies -- including in Taiwan, which seeks strength from Washington's security
guarantee as it defies Beijing.
US President Joe Biden, hammered over the disorderly retreat, has defended the withdrawal
saying China and Russia would ""love nothing more"" than his country to have continued to sink
resources into the Afghanistan quagmire.
But once the moment for quick point-scoring passes, China will take a much colder pragmatic
view of Afghanistan under the Taliban, analyst Hua said.

The total driving distance from Dhaka's commercial Motijheel district to the Bangabandhu

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/belt-and-road-initiative-fuels-rapid-growth-of-bangladeshi-businesses 1/8Some 3,000 people, including top government officials and leading businesses, flocked to
the three-day exhibition over the weekend, bringing together companies, especially those
from China, under one roof.
Scores of Chinese and Bangladeshi enterprises, banks, and government agencies used
more than 120 standard booths to demonstrate the achievements of the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) in Bangladesh.
""I came to this exhibition center after seeing the circular of the exhibition,"" said
Bangladeshi Himel, who uses a single name.
""I visited the Huawei stall and saw all Huawei technology and career enterprise solutions
here,"" Himel said, adding, ""I've also visited many Chinese stalls. It was very nice to visit this
exhibition.""
Himel said Bangladeshi people are also very familiar with Chinese technology and can use
an array of high-tech products made in China.
In the booth of Akij Jute Mills Limited, Abiruzzaman, the senior manager, was introducing
their products to the visitors passionately.
""I am very happy to participate here,"" Abiruzzaman said, adding that ""we export to China.
They are very good, and their cooperation mentality impressed us.""
Md Mujibur Rahman, managing director of Powervision Group, was thrilled to be the dealer
of Sany Heavy Industry India Pvt. Ltd. in Bangladesh.
Till now, the comprehensive market share of the main construction machinery products
from Sany exceeds 30 percent, and the market share was No.1 in Bangladesh for eight
consecutive years.
""Construction machines are essential for the BRI. According to that requirement, Sany has
been in Bangladesh for the past years and will continue to be,"" he said.
The BRI is doing development work in Bangladesh, Rahman said, adding that Bangladeshi
people know what the BRI is because ""development is not possible in Bangladesh without
the BRI.""
Both the countries benefit mutually from the BRI, a bridge and catalyst in paving the way
for the transfer of technology and more investment from China's public and private sectors,
said Mohammad Hatem, executive president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and25/05/2025, 11:20 Belt and Road Initiative fuels rapid growth of Bangladeshi businesses | The Financial Express

earning sector, the readymade garment.
He said there are big opportunities for Chinese investors to invest in Bangladesh because
""there is a ready market.""
""We want to go forward with the BRI. Bangladesh will go forward with the help of China and
the BRI.""
Bangladeshi government officials have also called for increased cooperation under the
framework of the China-proposed BRI, which they said has brought great changes to the
South Asian country.
They made the remarks on Friday when speaking at the opening ceremony of ""The Belt and
Road Initiative in Bangladesh Exhibition 2023,"" which marks the 10th anniversary of the
initiative.
The BRI has already brought transformative changes to Bangladesh as ""it has strengthened
our role as a vital connector in the regional trade network,"" Lokman Hossain Miah,
executive chairman of Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), said at the
ceremony attended by nearly 400 representatives of Chinese and Bangladeshi enterprises.
""Our participation in the BRI is a testament to our shared commitment. So, let us see this
moment, harness the opportunities it presents and work together to build a more
prosperous and interconnected world,"" said Miah, a senior secretary of the Bangladeshi
government.
Under the BRI, he said Bangladesh has implemented mega projects like the Padma Bridge
rail link, the 8th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge, and the Bangabandhu Bangladesh
China-Friendship Exhibition Center, among others.
Addressing the ceremony, A.H.M. Ahsan, vice chairman and chief executive officer of
Bangladesh's Export Promotion Bureau, said the BRI put forward 10 years ago is ""a
visionary project aimed at revitalizing the connectivity among Asia, Europe and Africa.""
""Over the past decade, we have witnessed the transformative impact of the BRI on global
trade and investment, with Bangladesh being an enthusiastic participant in this journey,""
he noted, reports Xinhua.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/education/347054/roundtable-discussion-on-china-bangladesh 1/3The Centre for East Asia Foundation (CEAF) organized a roundtable discussion on “China-
Bangladesh Relations and The Belt and Road Initiative” at the Abdullah Farque Conference Hall
of the Faculty of Business Studies of Dhaka University on Monday. 
The four-member high-level delegation led by Prof Dr Wang Jian, Director of the Shanghai
Academy of Social Sciences (SASS), China attended the program. Dean, Faculty of Business
Studies, University of Dhaka Prof Dr Muhammad Abdul Moyeen attended as the chief guest, and
former Ambassador and Chairman of CEAF Mahbub Uz Zaman moderated and chaired the
event.
The chief guest, Prof Dr M Abdul Moyeen, said Bangladesh, as a member of the BRI cooperation
alliance of China, has already started benefitting from the BRI, including China's financial
investment and contractual construction obligations.
""The investment made by the BRI will continue to contribute to the development initiative of
Bangladesh's competitiveness in the future and will help to achieve Vision 2041,"" he added. 
Nasim Mahmud, executive director of CEAF in his welcome remarks said China has always
extended its firm support to Bangladesh in safeguarding national sovereignty, independence, and
territorial integrity, and opposing external interference. China-Bangladesh relations are based on
mutual respect and win-win outcome.
The BRI cooperation embraces the historical trend of economic globalization, responds to the call
for improving the global governance system, and meets people's longing for a better life which is
the fundamental reason why it always has been strong. 
Ambassador of Bangladesh to China Mahbub Uz Zaman, in his concluding remarks, said: ""I am
convinced that under the framework of BRI, more and more Chinese enterprises and people will
devote themselves to the goal of Smart Bangladesh, proposing Chinese solutions and making
even more contributions to the realisation of Vision 2041.""

Terrorism is a global problem and both countries want to work together to combat it, he further

any country could join it for economic benefit. China is a very big exporter and importer and it
wants to have as many routes as possible to ensure supply to and from other countries, he added.
Former Bangladesh Ambassador to India Liaquat Ali CHowdhury said Bangladesh considers the
Belt and Road Initiative from the economic point of view as it can boost its trade volume and
earn revenue by using its location advantage if it can take the benefit of the initiative. President
Xi Jinping’s visit to Cambodia, Bangladesh and India will be “an important diplomatic activity”
aimed at boosting ties with South Asia, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said at
a press briefing on Monday. It will be the first state visit of a Chinese president to Bangladesh in
30 years. The last visit was in 1986 when then Chinese president Li Xiannian visited Dhaka. This
is also the second bilateral visit of Xi Jinping to Dhaka. He came to Dhaka in 2010 as Chinese
vice-president and planted a tree at Savar Mausoleum. “Bangladesh is China’s important partner
in the South Asian and the Indian Ocean region, and the visit will be a milestone for China-
Bangladesh relationship,” he said. Xi previously visited some South Asian countries, including
India and Sri Lanka, in 2014 and Pakistan last year.

Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain has said relations between Bangladesh and China
have set “an example of amicable coexistence and cooperative success,” calling for a “more
comprehensive approach” with the political changes in Dhaka. 
“Both countries, from the very beginning, supported each other on matters of core interests and
worked together on the path to realizing their respective development. Hence, diplomatic ties
between Bangladesh and China have set an example of amicable coexistence and cooperative
success,” the adviser said on Monday while speaking at a seminar on ""Bangladesh-China
Relations: A Future Outlook"" at InterContinental Dhaka.
“Now, as Bangladesh has witnessed the most significant political change in its national history,
therefore, the future of Bangladesh-China relations in a post-revolution setting requires a more
comprehensive approach,” he added.
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen and experts from both sides spoke at the seminar
organized by the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) in
collaboration with the Centre for China Studies, DU.
The foreign adviser said it is likely that the post-revolution trajectory of Bangladesh and its future
relations with China might be influenced by various factors, including Bangladesh's political
stability as well as the changing dynamics of regional and global politics.
“Yet, although the future of bilateral ties between Bangladesh and China can be shaped by several
factors, the core elements of cooperation such as aspects of trade and investment, infrastructure
development, and technology sharing need to endure, since these aspects are propelled by mutual
interests in economic advancement and regional stability,” Touhid said.
“In the coming days, along with focusing on the core elements, both countries can also expedite
meaningful collaboration on several other emerging areas such as green energy, tourism, satellite
technology and climate change.Publish : 14 Oct 2024, 02:59 PM

in the midst of evolving internal, regional and global dynamics, how this bilateral cooperation
can contribute to reorienting Bangladesh's post-revolution economic trajectory, and how this

Exchange Year: Yunnan Education and Health Promotion” at Dhaka University, Ambassador Yao
emphasized that people-to-people ties are now stronger than ever. The event was jointly
organized by the Yunnan Provincial Government and the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka.
“We will continue to promote a people-centric approach in our cooperation, especially in
education and public healthcare—two key areas for Bangladesh’s development and the welfare of
its people,” he said.
Highlighting the recent successful visit of Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus to China,
Yao expressed hope that it would further boost bilateral cooperation.
He also announced that hospitals—both public and private—in China’s Yunnan Province will
now accept more Bangladeshi patients, supported by visa facilitation.
“Thousands of patients from Bangladesh will travel to Yunnan for treatment and receive world-
class services,” he assured.
Welcoming the Bangladeshi government's approval for a new direct flight route from Chittagong
to Yunnan, Yao said the move would greatly enhance connectivity and people-to-people
exchange.
In another positive development, the ambassador shared that Bangladesh will export fresh
mangoes to China for the first time in history. Starting in late May, Kunming and other parts of
Yunnan will be the first to receive the fruit.
Reaffirming China’s support for Bangladesh’s progress, Yao said China remains committed to
investing in the country, creating jobs, and fostering mutual development under the Belt and Road
Initiative.
He also announced that 12 universities and six medical institutions from Yunnan are currently
visiting Dhaka to sign 10 cooperation agreements and set up five joint centers with Bangladeshi
universities.
“China’s door of cooperation will remain open,” he concluded, reiterating Beijing’s commitment
to regional development and stronger ties with Bangladesh.

Foreign adviser’s China tour: 10 extra
years for repaying Chinese loans
Wed Jan 22, 2025 12:00 AM
Last update on: Wed Jan 22, 2025 10:39 AM
Interest rates might be lowered
Beijing has agreed in principle to extend the repayment period for Chinese loans
and assured Dhaka it will look into the request to lower the interest rate to ease
Bangladesh's foreign debt repayment pressure.

China is Bangladesh's fourth-largest lender after Japan, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank, with total loans disbursed since 1975 coming to $7.5
billion.
The development came yesterday during Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain's
bilateral meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on his four-day tour of
China at the Diaoyuitai State Guest House in Beijing.
At the meeting, Hossain requested lowering the interest rate on Chinese loans
from 2-3 percent to 1 percent, waiving the commitment and management fees
and extending the loan repayment period from 20 years to 30 years for both the
preferential buyer's credit and government concessional loans.
Praising Bangladesh's good track record in repayment, Wang agreed to extend the
maturity period for loans provided to the country and also assured of looking into
the request of lowering the interest rate on the loans, according to a statement
from the Bangladesh foreign ministry.
China places Bangladesh at a very important position in her neighbourhood
diplomacy, the statement said quoting Wang as saying.
Also yesterday, Hossain held a meeting with Luo Zhaohui, the chairman of the
China International Development Cooperation Agency, about Chinese loans.
Hossain requested Luo to ramp up concessional loans and grants and the number
of projects China funds in Bangladesh. Luo responded positively and sought a list
of priority projects from Bangladesh.
Luo said China may consider larger projects in Bangladesh, with some project
funds extended as grants. As a result, the average interest rate of Chinese loans
will go down, he said.
Both sides also discussed the financing of projects in metro rail and the Southern
Infrastructure Development Initiative (SIDI) in Bangladesh.
Over at Hossain's bilateral meeting with the Chinese foreign minister, Beijing
assured of continued duty-free and quota-free access to Bangladeshi products for
three years after graduation from the least-developed country bracket in 2026.
Wang also conveyed China's decision to designate three to four recognised
hospitals in Kunming for treatment of Bangladeshi patients.
He also welcomed Bangladesh's proposal of setting up a specialised tertiary-level
Chinese hospital in Dhaka as a gesture of goodwill on the occasion of the 50th
anniversary of Bangladesh-China diplomatic relations.
Both sides conveyed their readiness to organise a host of activities to mark the
occasion.
Wang requested Bangladesh to consider joining Chinese President Xi Jinping's
three global initiatives: the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security
Initiative and the Global Civilisation Initiative.
In response, Bangladesh conveyed their intention to examine the proposals and
to remain engaged with China in deliberations on the issues.
Wang reaffirmed that China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Bangladesh and reiterated continued Chinese support for the stability, reforms,
democratic transition and development initiatives of Bangladesh.
Recognising Bangladesh's strategic position, the two sides emphasised continued
cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative.
China wants to see Bangladesh's economic development in pace with their own
development and assured China's continued support for the projects conducive to
the livelihood of the people of Bangladesh, Wang said.
The two sides expressed their willingness to work closely on proposed Chinese-
funded projects: the Dasherkandi sewage treatment plant, the upgradation and
modernisation of Mongla Port and the establishment of digital connectivity and
4G expansion.
The Chinese side was very positive about the request for lowering the interest rate
and financial support, an official of the foreign adviser's delegation told the
correspondent from Beijing.
""They have not insisted on their issues of GDI and GSI, but said they want us to be
with them for inclusive development,"" he said.
Bangladesh sought detailed information on China's plan to build a mega-
hydropower dam across the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet.
The Chinese side said they would not consume or withdraw any water and thus
the lower riparian countries will not be affected, the official said, adding that
there was no discussion on the Teesta river management project.
Both leaders discussed the Rohingya crisis and reaffirmed their shared
commitment to work on a roadmap to finding a durable solution to the issue,
according to the foreign ministry statement. Wang reassured China's continued
engagement with Myanmar to address the situation and promote regional
stability.
Hossain reiterated Bangladesh's firm commitment to the 'One China Principle'
and unwavering support for UNGA Resolution 2758.
The two countries signed the implementation plan for the memorandum of
understanding on the exchange of hydrological information on the Yaluzangbu-
Jamuna rivers.
Hossain also met with Liu Jianchao, the minister of the international department
of the Chinese Communist Party, yesterday to discuss Chinese-funded
development projects in Bangladesh.
Liu reaffirmed China's continued support for the interim government and
peaceful transition to democracy through a free, fair and participatory election.

Advising Bangladesh not to join the QUAD, Chinese Ambassador to Dhaka Li Ji-ming said in
a virtual discussion with DCAB on May 10, 2021, ""Bangladesh's decision to join the anti-
China alliance will harm bilateral relations."" The United States-led alliance Quadrilateral
Security Dialogue known as QUAD includes India, Japan and Australia as its allies.
The Chinese ambassador further said, ""I know the QUAD was formed deliberating over
China. Japan has already made it very clear that it is taking part in this US-led allianceBN
25/05/2025, 14:19 Bangladesh and the issue of QUAD | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/bangladesh-and-the-issue-of-quad-1624645330 1/9because of China, and that is why China does not want to see Bangladesh in such an
alliance"". At the end of April 2021, Chinese Defense Minister General Wei Feng visited Dhaka.
He also said that China and Bangladesh should work together to ensure that no external
power could create hegemony in the region. China's relation with the region goes long
before its inception. Bangladesh's ongoing development work in collaboration with China
is much more than that of India, Japan, Australia and even the United States. China is our
main partner in the country's development but they do never waste their time talking
about the country's politics, nor they interfere in its internal affairs. China's foreign policy is
very transparent and neutral in this regard; they are our most effective and real friend with
economic development activities.
On the other hand, Bangladesh's foreign policy too is neutral and transparent. ""Friendship
with all"" in line with non-align policy is the significant feature of Bangladesh's foreign
policy; so, there is no feasibility to join any military alliance. As such, definitely Bangladesh
will not join the alliance against any country; so, there is no reason for China to be worried
about its policy, Bangladesh is always quite alert and careful in this regard. Bangladesh's
foreign policy is ""neutral and balanced"", and in the light of which Bangladesh takes every
decision.
Munshi Fayez Ahmed, the former ambassador of Bangladesh to China, has given a very
good explanation in this regard saying that no one from the four countries has publicly
called on Bangladesh to join the QUAD so far, though we do not know whether or not
clandestinely some parties tried to do that, there might be some efforts. But Bangladesh
did not show any inclination either. He added further that there might be some parties who
convinced Chinese ambassador that Bangladesh was considering to join the QUAD, based
on which he alerted Bangladesh. Since China is a tested and trusted friend of Bangladesh,
bearing Bangladesh's welfare in their mind, they advised Bangladesh in advance which
should be considered a good suggestion for it.
Furthermore, it is very clear that the alliance was formed to curb China's diplomatic,
political and economic influence, and subsequently it came up with an Indo-Pacific strategy
as not too many countries showed their interest in it. There is no bar for Bangladesh to join
Indo-Pacific strategy for its socio-economic development but it definitely will not it join any
military alliance.
All these we have to make understandable to China. In the meantime, no one should come
up with any negative comment against the statement of Chinese ambassador and, making
no fuss, Bangladesh should simply clarify its stand against the assumption of China.
There is a good reason for China to be worried about the QUAD which was formed to resist
China and their advancement, but Bangladesh will never join this alliance, as mentioned
earlier. So China, the good friend of Bangladesh, should not be worried at all.
China is always a well-wisher of Bangladesh; and is a big partner in every development
programme of ours. So, rationally it should be a well-thought decision of Chinese
government to prevent Bangladesh from joining the QUAD, otherwise the ambassador25/05/2025, 14:19 Bangladesh and the issue of QUAD | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/bangladesh-and-the-issue-of-quad-1624645330 2/9would not have spoken to advise Bangladesh in that tone. Chinese Defense Minister
General Wai Feng Yi had already informed the Bangladesh government about the issue
diplomatically during his visit to Dhaka, despite all these China still thinks that Bangladesh
is playing a positive role in the QUAD issue.
It is a general diplomatic norm that any issue has to be reported from one government to
the other which China has naively handled. It can be termed a political strategy that the
Chinese ambassador did to create political pressure; it is important for our political parties
to play a role in preventing Bangladesh from joining the QUAD. The pro-China political
parties have to come forward in this regard. It is not unusual for China to be concerned if
Bangladesh joins the QUAD which is an alliance of major powers in cooperation with India,
a US initiative to resist China, but the question is: why did the Chinese ambassador talk
about it? Usually the Chinese ambassador does not speak on his own. He speaks only when
it is approved from the highest level of administration or given the responsibility to speak.
So, it is clear that China is really concerned about the issue, and when it failed to resolve
the issue diplomatically, only then the ambassador made it public with the intention of
exerting political pressure. Socially, too, those of us who see the country benefiting from
China's cooperation should also think about it. In the meantime, our civil society as well
should play a positive role.
Moreover, over the past few years, China has been quite vocal on various issues, and has
been openly playing a role in many international issues; so, it has spoken directly about the
issue - and there is nothing wrong with that, for the sake of the country, we have to accept
things as easy.
Bangladesh can join both the alliances led by the United States and China for the economic
development of Bangladesh; we are currently joining the US-led Indo-Pacific Alliance, and
the Chinese-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization. As such Bangladesh does not want to
belong to any coalition - that is what it means. There is no room to think that we are under
the control of America or China, if we join some organizations led by them. So, there should
be no such reason for China to be concerned about Bangladesh joining the US-led Indo-
Pacific Alliance.
Over the past few years, Bangladesh has been playing a balanced role in foreign policy,
Bangladesh is always persistent for its own interest, various quarters and individuals have
long been advising Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on numerous issues but she is deliberately
doing what is needed for the prosperity of the country. The statement of the foreign
minister in this regard is quite striking. He said: ""we adhere to and maintain a neutral and
balanced foreign policy"".
The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD, also known as the QUAD) began in 2007 among
the leaders of the four countries, the United States, Japan, India, and Australia. To form this
alliance, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe initiated it first in 2007, and then he was
backed by US Vice President Dick Cheney, Australian Prime Minister John Howard and
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The type of alliance was ""Inter-Governmental25/05/2025, 14:19 Bangladesh and the issue of QUAD | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/bangladesh-and-the-issue-of-quad-1624645330 3/9Security Forum"". As China's economic and military strength continues to grow, so the
agenda of the four countries should be the one based on this.
The United States, India, Australia and Japan are currently closely monitoring the situation
and the perspective after the Chinese ambassador addressed Bangladesh. In a briefing on
May 12, 2021, US State Department spokesman Ned Price, answering a question, said: ""we
are monitoring the statement made by the Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh"". We
respect the sovereignty of Bangladesh and at the same time, we respect their right to make
decisions on its foreign policy by their own. Further he added that the United States had an
incredible relationship with Bangladesh, and the two countries were working on a wide
range of issues on a partnership basis, from economic growth to climate change. They
decided to form the QUAD in the Indo-Pacific region. The QUAD is a non-partisan but
important organization where the United States, India, Australia and Japan will work
together to form a free and open Indo-Pacific region of like-minded democracies.
Meanwhile, China has clarified its position with Bangladesh on whether to join the QUAD or
not. Recently, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Qinying said in a regular briefing
that Bangladesh-China relations had been built on the principle of peaceful coexistence.
Reiterating the good relations, she said: ""I want to make it clear that China and Bangladesh
are very close neighbours; we have built our relationship based on the five principles of
peaceful coexistence"".
China-Bangladesh relations are very strong, old, and resilient; as an economic comrade, we
have no alternative to China. It is China, which has challenged the United States as the
world's political and economic leader, it already has repeatedly explained why it opposes
the QUAD. So, for the sake of the continuation of the pace of development of Bangladesh, it
would be wrong in every way to join the QUAD.

https://www.thedailystar.net/bangladesh-national-election-2018/china-communist-party-greets-awami-league-victory-in-11th-parliamentary-election-168… 2/6Body: 
In the first parliament 45 years ago, none of the parties was recognised as official opposition due to their poor strength in the House.
The resounding victory of ruling Awami League-led alliance in Sunday's polls has diminished the scope for emergence of an official
opposition in the new parliament.
The AL-led alliance together grabbed 288 seats out of 298 with the ruling party alone bagging 259 seats. The BNP-led alliance managed to
secure only seven seats. [Election to Gaibandha-3 was rescheduled to January 27 following the death of a candidate and re-polling will take
place in three centres in Brahmanbaria-2 on January 9.]
Against this backdrop, Jatiya Party may sit on the opposition bench in the new parliament to be formed with MPs-elect swearing in
tomorrow.
The JP, a key component of the AL-led grand electoral alliance, emerged as the second largest party by obtaining 20 seats.
It needs at least five more to get official recognition as the opposition, according to the verbal directive given by Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman during a debate in the first parliament on April 12, 1973.
In the first parliamentary election held in 1973, the AL won 293 seats. The opposition parties -- Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, Bangladesh Jatiya
League, National Awami Party and others obtained only seven seats.
They extended their support to Jatiya League leader Ataur Rahman Khan and demanded that he be recognised as the leader of the  
opposition.   
During the debate over recognition as opposition, Bangabandhu said a party could not be recognised as opposition if it did not have at least
25 MPs.
If any group has less than 25 MPs and at least 10 MPs, it can be termed a parliamentary group, not a parliamentary party, said Bangabandhu.
""The speech delivered by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is the only directive,"" wrote Khandaker Abdul Haq in his book
""Parliamentary Practice and Procedure"" published by the Jatiya Sangsad Secretariat in 2001.
""His directive has been derived from experiences of the Pakistan National Assembly and East Pakistan Provincial Assembly and it is
consistent with the parliamentary culture of India and this sub-continent,"" wrote Haq, who was a senior official at the Parliament Secretariat.
If Bangabandhu's directive is taken into consideration, JP would need five more seats to qualify to become the opposition party in the new
parliament. If JP is not the official opposition, none of its MPs could be the leader of the opposition.
The JP became the main opposition in the current parliament formed through the 2014 election, which the BNP-led alliance boycotted. It won
34 seats and its senior leader Raushan Ershad was recognised as the leader of the opposition with a status of a minister. Three JP MPs were
also made ministers.
Their dual role has been criticised. The party could not play its due role as the main opposition in parliament in the last five years.
JP Secretary General Mashiur Rahman Ranga yesterday said his party would hold a joint meeting of the party's presidium members and
MPs-elect today to decide whether it would join the government or sit on the opposition bench.
""We will also discuss it with the grand alliance,"" he said at a discussion at the party's Banani office.
Body: 
The High Court (HC) today rejected a writ petition that challenged the legality of oath taking by lawmakers elected in the December 30
general election.
The court came up with the order saying that there is nothing illegal in taking oath taken by the lawmakers as they took charges of their
offices on January 30.
The HC bench of Justice Sheikh Hassan Arif and Justice Razik-Al-Jalil passed the order.
Earlier on February 6, the court concluded hearing on the petition and fixed today (February 18) for passing an order.
On that day, AM Mahbub Uddin Khokon argued that oath taking by the lawmakers on January 3 was unconstitutional as the tenure of the
10th parliament expired on January 28.
“Therefore, there were two parliaments from January 3 to January 28 -- which is unconstitutional,” he told the court on February 6.
Attorney General MahbubeyAlamhad argued that as new lawmakers took charge on January 30, oath taking was not illegal.
Body: 
Two Gonoforum lawmakers-elect yesterday wrote to the Speaker expressing their willingness to take oath on March 7.
Sultan Mohammad Monsur and Mokabbir Khan, presidium members of Gonoforum, took part in the December 30 national election as
Gonoforum candidates, with the BNP's electoral symbol “sheaf of paddy”.
Asked about the matter, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told The Daily Star that he did not know anything about the
letter.
Senior Gonoforum leaders said they would take all kinds of actions against the two leaders if they took oath disobeying the party's decision.
Just around a month before the national election, the BNP, the Gonoforum and some other political parties had formed Jatiya Oikyafront.25/05/2025, 15:56 China Communist Party (CPC) greets Awami League | The Daily Star
https://www.thedailystar.net/bangladesh-national-election-2018/china-communist-party-greets-awami-league-victory-in-11th-parliamentary-election-168… 3/6Oikyafront leaders, including Dr Kamal Hossain, boycotted the polls results and called for a new election.
The BNP won only six seats against 289 by the ruling Awami League-led Grand Alliance.
All the six MPs-elect of BNP decided not to join the Jatiya Sangsad.
Talking to this newspaper, Sultan Monsur yesterday said Dr Kamal knew about their oath.
Mostafa Mohsin Montu, general secretary of Gonoforum, said the two leaders would violate the party's decision if they took oath.
“Our party has decided not to send the two MPs to parliament. We will take all necessary actions if they take oath.”
Montu also said the duo was misleading people by giving false statements.
If they took oath violating the party's decision, the Gonoforum would write to the Speaker to cancel their memberships for floor-crossing, he
said.
Former Awami League leader Sultan Mansur, also an ex vice-president of Ducsu, was elected MP from Moulvibazar-2 and Mokabbir from
Sylhet-2.
Soon after the December 30 election, the duo said Kamal was positive about their joining parliament.
On January 31, Kamal told journalists that the Gonoforum has informed the two about its decision that they should not take oath.

Ambassador of Switzerland to Bangladesh René Holenstein today said Switzerland commended all parties for their participation in 11th
Parliamentary Elections in Bangladesh.
“Switzerland took note of the results of the 11th Parliamentary Elections and commended all parties for their participation in the process,”
said Holenstein during a meeting with Bangladesh Foreign Secretary M Shahidul Haque today.
The Swiss ambassador deplored the violence that occurred before and during the elections causing unnecessary suffering and pain,
according to astatement

fbclid=IwAR3VdA8HVz28gemrj0o_W3s8_fFUXD2VYzkoG0sTHqVi1G0DqBb6GzlYUOo).
Referring to reported accounts of intimidation, irregularities and further obstacles to a level playing field throughout the process, which have
tainted the electoral campaign and the vote, Ambassador Holenstein underlined the need to address these reports in full transparency and
according to the rule of law.
“Switzerland trusts that the new Government of Bangladesh will uphold the democratic values it was elected upon and that it will support
the people’s will to move towards democracy in full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms,” he said.
He assured the foreign secretary that Switzerland looked forward to its continued partnership with Bangladesh.
Body: 
Condemning violence in Bangladesh, the United Nations has urged all sides to show restraint and ensure a peaceful post electoral
environment (https://www.thedailystar.net/bangladesh-national-election-2018) in the country.
The USA and the European Union have also denounced violence over the just concluded parliamentary elections, and called for addressing all
electoral complaints in a peaceful manner.
Welcoming the participation of all major political parties in the general election for the first time in 10 years, they said it was a positive
development which reflected aspirations of people for democracy.
The spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement on Monday said, “The United Nations is aware of violent
incidents and reports of irregularities in the Bangladesh general election.”
The UN regretted the loss of life and injuries sustained by candidates and voters during the electoral campaign and on the voting day, it said.
US STATEMENT
The US in a statement yesterday commended the Bangladeshis who voted in the election as well as the decision of all major opposition
parties to participate.
“The United States remains deeply invested in the future of Bangladesh and its democratic development. The United States is Bangladesh's
largest foreign investor, largest single-country market for Bangladeshi exports, and home to a large community of Americans of Bangladeshi
origin,” said Robert Palladino, deputy spokesperson of the US state department.
However, it expressed concern over reports of harassment, intimidation, and violence in the pre-election period saying that those incidents
made it difficult for many opposition candidates and their supporters to meet, hold rallies, and campaign freely. “We are also concerned that
election-day irregularities prevented some people from voting, which undermined faith in the electoral process.”
He said his country strongly encourages all parties to refrain from violence and request the EC to work constructively with all sides to
address claims of irregularities.
“Bangladesh's impressive record of economic development and respect for democracy and human rights are mutually reinforcing, and we
look forward to continue working with the ruling government and opposition towards advancing these interrelated goals,” reads the
statement.25/05/2025, 15:56 China Communist Party (CPC) greets Awami League | The Daily Star

The EU said the mobilisation of voters and the participation of the opposition in the polls reflected the people's aspirations for democracy.
“However, violence has marred the election day, and significant obstacles to a level playing field remained in place throughout the process
and have tainted the electoral campaign and the vote,” an EU spokesperson said in a statement yesterday.
Maja Kocijancic, spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy of the EU, in his statement said the relevant authorities should now
ensure a proper examination of allegations of irregularities and commit to full transparency in their resolution.

For a better strategic partnership

Since Bangladesh gained its independence in 1971, it has followed Bangabandhu
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's principle of friendship towards all, malice towards
none in dictating its foreign policy. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 41
years ago, Bangladesh and China have had a relationship of shared mutual
Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that his country wants a better strategic
relationship with Bangladesh.
cooperation in the economic, military, technological and cultural fields. Both
countries also share the same outlook on a number of important international
and regional issues.
During the 41-year period, there have been state visits by senior officials from
both countries. This is a clear sign that Bangladesh gives a lot of importance to its
relations with China, and vice versa.
During my tenure as the Bangladesh Ambassador to China from August 1987 to
October 1991, I witnessed the early years of China's rapid economic growth. This
growth was evident from my travels around China in places like Shanghai,
Tianjin, Guanzhou, Qingdao, Nanjing, Dalian, Kunming, Chengdu, Chongking,
Wuhan, Xiamen and many other cities all across the country. During this period, I
witnessed the surge in tourism with countless new hotels being opened across
the country and a large number of the world's leading companies establishing
offices in Beijing and other parts of China. Since my departure from China 25
years ago, I have had the opportunity to visit China 15 times. The transformation
even within a space of one year has been quite extraordinary. No other country
has come close to this type of rapid economic development.
For Bangladesh, economic ties with China are of great significance. The bilateral
trade and economic relations between the two countries have strengthened
enormously over the years. China is now the largest trading partner of
Bangladesh. For China, Bangladesh is its third biggest trading partner in South
Asia. However, we believe that there is scope for Bangladesh to increase its
exports to China to address the large trade imbalance which favours China. In
2014, bilateral trade between the two countries had increased to over USD12
billion.
In March 2010, during the official visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to  China,
both countries agreed to establish a ""Closer Comprehensive Partnership of
Cooperation"" from the strategic perspective and on the basis of the principles of
longstanding friendship, equality, and mutual benefit. Agreements on co-
operation in the areas of oil, gas, minerals and agriculture were signed.
As Bangladesh continues to develop its infrastructure, China has become an
important partner in this venture. As a result, during Prime Minister Hasina's
visit, both countries signed three major agreements and a MOU under which the
Chinese Government would assist Bangladesh in infrastructure development
projects. Also, during the Prime Minister's visit, the Chinese government agreed
to provide grants for seven major projects, including the construction of road and
rail infrastructure connecting Chittagong with Kunming through Myanmar,
construction of the eighth Bangladesh-China friendship bridge and support for
the construction of the Chinese Exhibition Centre.
It is in the areas of trade and investment that China's relations with Bangladesh
can truly flourish. For instance, the construction of a road from Chittagong to
Kunming will also cut through Myanmar, thereby benefiting the economies of all
three countries.
There is also scope for increasing investment ties with China, as the Bangladesh
government is making greater efforts to attract greater amounts of foreign direct
investment from countries like China. Since the Awami League-led government
assumed power following the December 2008 elections, there has been a marked
improvement in business relations between the two countries. There is promise
of yet further investment from the Chinese side, while the government has
offered to set up a special economic zone for China. 
In June 2010, at the invitation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the then Chinese
Vice President Xi Jinping, who is now the President of China, paid an official visit
to Bangladesh. President Xi and Prime Minister Hasina held discussions on
boosting bilateral ties based on agreement on a four-point proposal. The
proposals included maintaining frequent high-level exchanges, expanding
economic cooperation, exploring more fields for cooperation and strengthening
cultural exchanges. 
From July 1, 2010, China allowed duty free access to 4,721 Bangladeshi products
to its markets. This important initiative in due course of time will help
Bangladesh reduce its large trade imbalance with China.
With the aim of opening up new areas of economic cooperation, Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina visited China from June
6 to 11, 2014 where she had very constructive discussions with Chinese leaders on
various bilateral, regional and international issues. During the visit, both
countries signed six instruments for execution of different projects and
agreement was reached under which China will support five more projects in
Bangladesh at a total cost of USD5 billion.
In 2014, the Bangladesh government awarded China a USD1.55 billion contract to
build the Padma Bridge. Work on this key project is progressing well and is
expected to be completed in 2018. In a further deepening of ties with Bangladesh,
in February 2015, the Chinese government agreed to finance 10 large
infrastructure projects estimated to cost over USD 8.5 billion. China has more
than 100 companies that are doing business in Bangladesh in garments, textiles,
jute and general manufacturing. China has sought land from the government for
a special economic zone for Chinese companies.
In August 2016, the China Railway Group, one of the world's largest construction
companies, was awarded a USD 3.1 billion project to build a rail network in
Bangladesh connecting the capital Dhaka to Jessore in southwestern Bangladesh.
The four lane Dhaka-Chittagong highway built by a Chinese company is another
landmark project. Chinese companies have also been actively involved in the
power, textile, water treatment and telecom sectors. One of the most important
projects in the pipeline is the tunnel under the Karnaphuli River in Chittagong.
Chinese companies are also expected to build two four lane elevated expressways,
which should play an important part in overcoming traffic congestion in the
country.  
Bangladesh and China have, over the last four decades, also developed strong
military and defence cooperation. China has provided training to Bangladesh's
armed forces and members of both armed forces have undertaken courses in
each other's defense colleges.
Over the years, there have been regular high-level bilateral visits of military
officials from both sides. Most recently, Bangladesh Navy chief Admiral
Nizamuddin Ahmed visited China to officiate at a ceremony for the construction
of two Corvette warships. Further high level visits are expected to take place
during the coming months.
In 2013, China's leader President Xi Jinping unveiled the strategic international
development strategy and framework known as the One Belt One Road Policy
(OBOR). China aims to increase its cooperation with other states in Eurasia, Africa
and South and Southeast Asia creating a global 'network of infrastructure
partnerships'.
The OBOR has been described as China's 'Marshall Plan'. This grand vision
cleverly reflects the history of the old Silk Road trade routes to shape a vision for
China's 21st century and beyond. With 'one eye in the past and one eye in the
future' China aims to bring economic success to more than 60 states, comprising
60 percent of the world's population and 46 percent of the world's GDP. As one of
the world's largest economies and the number one trading partner for 120
countries, China holds almost unprecedented power and responsibility.
Bangladesh is fully supportive of OBOR and believes that the OBOR policy has the
potential to be a game changer for the global market. It has the opportunity to
create opportunities and increase the prosperity of not only developing nations
but developed nations.
Bangladesh has been a strong supporter of the BCIM economic corridor linking
China, Myanmar, Bangladesh and India together. This initiative which was earlier
known as the Kunming initiative it is hoped will produce some tangible results in
the coming years. Bangladesh has also actively participated in an initiative
launched by China last year: The Trans Himalayan Development Forum.
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations over 40 years ago, Sino-
Bangladesh relations have expanded significantly to cover a wide range of
subjects. Whilst defence and economic co-operation remain the two principal
pillars of cooperation, there is a need to expand this cooperation in other areas.
Bangladesh needs to attract Chinese investments in to Bangladesh and also
improve connectivity between China and Bangladesh.
Bangladesh has continually demonstrated its interest to maintain close and
friendly relations with China, and as far as possible to partake in the ever
expanding political, economic and defence relations between the two friendly
nations. In addition, with President Xi Jinping's scheduled visit to Dhaka, the
bilateral relations will be further enhanced between the two time-tested friends.
Thus ties between the two friendly nations will undoubtedly continue to grow,
and do so for many more decades to come.

unilateral sanctions,"" he said.
The ambassador said they must uphold the international system with the United Nations at
its core, the international order based on international law, and the basic norms governing
international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.

“In diplomacy, everything is complex and everything
is simple at the same time.” – Lester B. Pearson.
Bangladesh interim government chief Dr Muhammad Yunus will visit China on March 26 in a
historic initiative reflective of a watershed moment for the nationʼs evolving foreign policy
dynamics. It is its first official Beijing trip since taking office in August and is both delicate
and well-timed. It comes ahead of heightened regional tensions—with Bangladesh-India
relations strained occasioned by popular mass rebellion and the erstwhile prime minister
Sheikh Hasina resignations.
What makes the visit memorable and underscores its diplomatic significance is Chinaʼs
gesture: a special chartered flight offered by President Xi Jinping to take Yunus to Beijing.
Such an unusual and symbolic gesture refers to how much Bangladeshʼs new leadership
means to China and the potential reconfiguration of regional blocs. The invitation is out of
protocol—a show of will, reiterating Chinaʼs determination to seal strategic relations with
Dhaka at the underlying reordering of the region.
Yunus has on his agenda giving a keynote address at the upmarket Boao Forum for Asia in
Hainan and having high-level bilateral talks with senior Chinese leaders, including
President Xi Jinping. These contacts envision traditional diplomacy and a broader recasting
of Bangladeshʼs geopolitics—a new quest for diversified alliances, economic engagement,
and greater sovereignty during regional powersʼ rivalries.
strategic  opportunity: Yunusʼ visit is strategically vital as it offers an opportunity to realign
and possibly strengthen ties with China in the wake of the strained relations with India.
The Boao Forum for Asia talks and subsequent meetings with Chinese leaders will likely
focus on a series of significant areas:
Economic Cooperation and Trade Imbalance. Bangladeshʼs largest trading partner, China,
dominates its economy. The trade imbalance between the two countries, however, isBN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/strategic-implications-of-yunuss-visit-to-china 1/7astronomical—Bangladesh exported merchandise valued at close to $677 million to China
in 2023, compared to imports from China totalling an astronomical $22.9 billion. The
imbalance underscores the need to renegotiate more balanced terms of trade that will
come a long way toward economic stability for Bangladesh. Correcting this imbalance can
potentially increase market access for Bangladesh products in China, perhaps in markets
where Bangladesh has competitive advantages such as textiles, farm produce, and
technology services. For China, greater trade cooperation can diversify its supply chain and
deepen bilateral economic cooperation, which is essential for South Asian market access.
Political Alliance and Strategic Support. In a time of climactic shift in the political order,
Bangladesh is firmly redefining its internal governance and international positioning. To
that end, forging close relations with China—renowned for its adamant policy of non-
interference—is a principal political source of strength for Yunusʼs transition government.
Compared with Western participation models, where conditions are very heavy, the
Chinese model provides more flexibility in cooperation that could translate into higher
legitimacy and independence of Yunusʼs government in the international community.
For Beijing, greater access to Bangladesh is a strategic imperative for projecting its
influence throughout South Asia so that Dhaka is fully integrated into regional
memberships like SAARC and BIMSTEC. This alliance fits for Chinaʼs Belt and Road initiative
and expands its presence in the Bay of Bengal, an essential Indo-Pacific maritime zone of
geopolitics. Bangladesh benefits highly from Chinaʼs prowess in infrastructure construction,
industrialization, and digitalization—core sectors that are pivotal in spearheading its
development endeavors.
Yunus must make the most of this visit to engage Chinese leaders in meaningful
negotiations on ramping up foreign direct investment in Bangladesh. In case of successful
negotiations, the visit can prove to be a turning point in Dhakaʼs economic diplomacy,
opening new avenues for long-term strategic partnership and regional peace.
Infrastructure and Investment. Chinaʼs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has already seen
considerable investment in Bangladeshʼs roads, bridges, and power infrastructure to drive
connectivity and industrial capacity. Its deepening cooperation can also involve more
investment in Bangladeshʼs digital infrastructure, green energy sectors, and urban planning
programs, which would be consistent with its goal of becoming a middle-income country.
To China, these investments solidify its position in a strategically located country and
create a platform for Chinese companies and integrate them into regional economic and
trade procedures. Both nations are interested in a sustainable activity that places social and
environmental concerns first, with long-term rewards rather than fast money.
Regional Stability and Security. The ongoing Rohingya crisis and Bay of Bengal security are
the most essential matters for Bangladesh in terms of foreign affairs and domestic peace.
With diplomatic negotiations with China, Bangladesh can employ Chinese power in
Myanmar to pressure the resolution of the Rohingya crisis in a vision of repatriation in
security and regional stability. Additionally, Chinaʼs concern with the Bay of Bengal as a
strategic location for the protection of sea lanes can complement Bangladeshʼs security
concerns, offering a shared maritime security and anti-piracy policy. A further expansion of
cooperation on this basis would enhance regional security and Yunusʼs profile at home and
abroad as an effective regional conflict mediator.
In essence, Yunusʼs visit to China could result in a series of strategic bonds and actions that
would benefit the two nations. It is an opportunity for Bangladesh to balance its political
and economic relations and short- and long-term development goals. China is
consolidating its diplomatic and economic influence in South Asia, ensuring a peaceful and
prosperous regional environment that will benefit its overall geopolitical and economic
interests.
Strategic Diplomacy for Humanitarian Solution: During his forthcoming meeting with
President Xi Jinping, Dr. Muhammad Yunus will probably emphasize two of South Asiaʼs
most pressing humanitarian and security concerns: the repatriation of Rohingya refugees
from Bangladesh to Myanmar and the growing threat of the Arakan Army. These
discussions are of critical importance since Bangladesh is constantly looking to take the
lead in the acute crisis of humanitarian proportions triggered by the displacement of
Rohingya nationals. The repatriation of refugees safely and with dignity is not only a
question of regional stability but also one of core human rights which demands
international intervention to ensure and guarantee their security and well-being in the long
term.
Yunus will emphasise Chinaʼs leverage in convincing Myanmar to speed up a systematic and25/05/2025, 14:31 Strategic implications of Yunus's visit to China | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/strategic-implications-of-yunuss-visit-to-china 2/7humane repatriation plan. He will invoke Beijingʼs diplomatic influence to secure a
sustainable agreement that guarantees the security and rights of the returning Rohingya
people. The dialogue will also address the evolving security landscape, more precisely the
impact of the Arakan Armyʼs operations. Dr. Yunus will stress the imperative of peacefully
and pragmatically resolving such tensions, one that acknowledges the regionʼs intricate
socio-political dynamics and advances long-term stability.
Through this high-level diplomatic initiative, Dr. Yunus aims to reiterate the importance of
multilateral action in addressing one of the regionʼs most serious humanitarian crises. By
facilitating collective responsibility towards regional security, human rights, and peace, he
aims to advocate for an integrated strategy that meets the immediate needs of refugees
and strives for geopolitical balance and coexistence.
Employment of the Teesta: Bangladesh is at a juncture where it needs to manage its water
resources, which are of paramount significance not only for agriculture but for the overall
sustainable development of other industries. The most crucial among these is the potential
introduction and application of the Teesta River project. Not only is the project beneficial,
but it is something Bangladesh also needs, and it has many benefits that extend far beyond
immediate water wants.
The Teesta River, which passes through the Sikkim and West Bengal states of India en route
to Bangladesh, is a critical water source for Bangladeshʼs northern part. Managing and
utilising the waters of the Teesta effectively is crucial to Bangladesh, particularly given its
reliance on agriculture, particularly in the dry northern districts. Having an integrated
project undertaken on the Teesta River would be incredibly beneficial in augmenting
irrigation, thereby enhancing farm output, maintaining food security, and fostering socio-
economic development in such areas.
Apart from this, the project can also be instrumental in flood control. The regions on the
banks of the Teesta witness seasonal floods, which would otherwise cause severe economic
damage and displace the population. A well-planned river project could include the
construction of dams and reservoirs, which would regulate river flow and reduce flood
impacts. The infrastructure projects could also generate hydroelectric power, which would
supply the countryʼs national grid and improve energy security.
Aside from its irrigation and flood control functions, the Teesta River project will help
expand inland water transport, an inexpensive and environmentally friendly mode of
transport. The development of this project would open up new channels of movement and
trade that would integrate remote areas with vast markets and thus trigger economic
growth in remote areas.
But the success of such an initiative depends on proper regional coordination, especially
with India, as the river flows across international boundaries. Bangladesh must be
committed to diplomatic negotiations that involve equitable and fair water-sharing treaties
that are beneficial and fair to all parties involved, especially in light of climate change and
its implications for water resources.
By advancing a sound argument in favour of Bangladesh, the Teesta River project is a
matter of strategic imperative for Bangladesh as it addresses several water management,
economic development, and environmental sustainability issues. By prioritising this
project, Bangladesh can gain long-term benefits that will further solidify its agricultural
base, enable its natural disaster resilience capacity, and provide its overall development
trajectory an added impetus.
Aside from its direct influence, the project promises to drive overall economic development
and sustainability. In its secure water provision and natural disaster risk protection, the
project guarantees the pillars of a booming economy with opportunities for future
investment and sustainable development. Therefore, the Teesta River project is not just an
infrastructural project; it is a strategic investment in Bangladeshʼs future that can take the
countryʼs development path to new heights and cement its position as a robust and
sustainable economy in the global arena.
Diplomatic Nuances and India: Whereas Muhammad Yunus would like to increase the
relationship of Bangladesh with China, he also had to walk with a careful stride toward
India. With recent developments like the aggressive policy of India and the granting of
asylum to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, more individuals amongst the masses of
Bangladesh support increasing the connection of Bangladesh with China. It is seen as a way
of offsetting Indian influence and having more diplomatic independence. Therefore,
Yunusʼs trip to China should not be interpreted as the beginning of a flip from India but as a
canny diversification of interests that enhances Bangladeshʼs sovereignty in global affairs.25/05/2025, 14:31 Strategic implications of Yunus's visit to China | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/strategic-implications-of-yunuss-visit-to-china 3/7These sensitive diplomacy issues are partly because of the deep historic and geographic
ties which bind India and Bangladesh. These bonds, forged by shared cultural heritage and
economic interdependencies, require Bangladesh to maintain an assertive but respectful
relationship with India. The policy has to make every effort to convince India that the
strengthening of relations with China is not a rejection of the Indo-Bangladeshi relationship
but a quest for an even-handed foreign policy with the national interests of Bangladesh as
the dominant concern.
In addition, this shift in this complex diplomatic environment requires Bangladesh to
declare its stance firmly and decisively so that its move would not be perceived as a
reaction to Indian policy but as a move to diversify its foreign relations. Through this,
Bangladesh can establish mutual respect and cooperation with India while reaping the
benefits of a higher relationship with China. This action preserves valuable regional
relationships and proclaims Bangladesh an independent country free to make its own
decisions in a changing world geopolitical scenario.
Conclusion: Yunusʼs visit to China could be a benchmark in Bangladeshʼs foreign policy in
regional sensitivities. It offers an opportunity
to balance economic inequalities, win political friends during a change,
and receive even more significant investments. The trip will also test Yunusʼs diplomatic
acumen to maintain an emerging close rapport with China without upsetting the regional
neighbour India, which has been in balance so far. While Yunus embarks on this significant
diplomatic venture, the outcome can redefine Bangladeshʼs regional
political identity and long-term strategic allegiances. As Henry Kissinger would one day
state, “Diplomacy is the art of restraining power.” Yunusʼs diplomatic skill, in that sense,
could not only shape Bangladeshʼs foreign policy but also its domestic stability and its
regional clout.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/302434/bangladesh-maintaining-good-relations-with-both 1/3Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen on Tuesday said Bangladesh is maintaining good
relations with both global powers USA and China through its balanced foreign policy, though it is
a “challenging” task.
“That is a challenging thing. They (US, China) might have their own problems. That is their
headache, not ours. We want to maintain good relations with both,” he said.
Momen made the remarks when a reporter wanted to know how the Bangladesh government is
maintaining relations with the United States and China
The foreign minister referred to the historic quote of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, “Friendship to all, malice towards none”, which has recently been
incorporated in a UN General Assembly resolution. “We believe in this policy,” Momen said.
Momen received the newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang during the latter's brief
stopover at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport early today while US Senior Director for South
Asia, National Security Council, Rear Admiral Eileen Laubacher, wrapped up her four-day visit
to Bangladesh.
On the other hand, a delegation of the International Department of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), led by Vice Minister Chen Zhou, is currently visiting
Bangladesh to have interactions with Bangladesh leadership.
The CPC delegation is scheduled to leave Dhaka on January 11 while Donald Lu, who became
Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs on September 15,
2021, is likely to begin his Bangladesh visit on January 15.
Asked whether Bangladesh-US discussed the election issue during US official Laubacher's visit,
Momen said the next national election will be held after one year, and over the last 14 years,
elections were held in a free, fair manner. “Our country is a democratic country.”
He said the overall election environment can be improved through joint efforts domestically with
the participation of people and all parties.
Momen said it would be unfortunate if anyone violence occurs during elections and it cannot be
stopped by “recommendations from the outside. We have to do this.”

of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, people will re-elect Awami League for their better future.
“We believe in people. People will vote for Awami League if there is a fair election. Awami

of the interim government of Bangladesh, adding, ""Our relationship has been very strong over the
years. Our business is very strong and we benefit from our collaboration with China.""
In a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua, Yunus said he expected bilateral relations to enter a
new stage.
""Everybody in Bangladesh is inspired by what China has achieved,"" Yunus said, adding that the
interim government's task is to rebuild a new Bangladesh, and the Bangladeshi people hope they
can learn from China's experience in developing their own country.
Regarding China's poverty reduction achievement, Yunus said that most countries focus on GDP
growth rather than addressing the needs of ordinary people, but China focused on the low-income
group. ""That's why the Chinese are very successful in reducing poverty very quickly.""
Trade and economic cooperation between Bangladesh and China witnessed high-level
development in recent years. China has been Bangladesh's largest trading partner for 15
consecutive years. At present, there are nearly 1,000 Chinese enterprises operating in Bangladesh,
which have created more than 550,000 jobs in total.
Yunus noted that the two countries have established ties of extensive cooperation, which have
produced many positive outcomes. ""Bangladesh's imports from China are increasing. The bulk of
our industrial-use products come from China.""
Looking ahead, Yunus emphasized the economic complementarities between the two countries
and their huge cooperation potential, saying that he hopes more Chinese investors will come to
Bangladesh and open up a broader market together with local partners.
Recently, the first group of Bangladeshi patients, doctors, and travel agencies went to Kunming in
China's Yunnan Province for medical check-ups and treatment, exploring the potential for the
medical tourism market.
Yunus said Bangladesh could learn from China and build a better health care system to benefit
the people.

scholar Atisha Dipankar contributing to the spread of Buddhism in China, Yunus highlighted the
long history of friendly exchanges between Bangladesh and China, which laid a solid foundation
for the fast and sustained development of bilateral relations.

economy, but a new kind of economy where everybody participates,"" Yunus said.

will be cultural,"" he said.

An inter-ministerial meeting, chaired by the foreign secretary, was held at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs on Sunday to discuss Bangladesh’s agenda for a key meeting with Chinese President Xi
Jinping. 
The discussions covered political relations, trade, health, water, foreign loans, agriculture,
connectivity and energy cooperation. 
The foreign ministry is working to finalize the specific issues Bangladesh will present during the
talks.
A senior foreign ministry official said various ministries presented cooperation proposals related
to China at the inter-ministerial meeting, including a list of key projects. 
In coordination with the Chief Adviser’s Office, Bangladesh’s stance for the bilateral meeting
with President Xi will be determined, they added. 
Tentative itinerary
The chief adviser is scheduled to leave for China on March 26 to attend the Boao Forum for Asia
Conference in Hainan Province. 
On March 27, he will deliver a speech at the conference’s opening plenary session. He may also
meet with China’s Executive Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
On March 28, Chief Adviser Yunus is set to meet President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the
People in Beijing. On the same day, he will visit a high-tech enterprise under Huawei.
Additionally, a leading Chinese media outlet will conduct an interview with him.

destination. 
However, due to visa complications, patients with critical illnesses are facing difficulties. 
Bangladesh has requested China to designate four hospitals in Kunming specifically for
Bangladeshi patients, ensuring a supportive treatment environment. 
The first batch of Bangladeshi patients departed for China on Monday.
Dhaka has also proposed that Beijing assist in establishing a world-class hospital in Bangladesh.
This initiative aims to provide advanced medical facilities domestically while maintaining an
option for treatment in China.
A government official said: “Whether Bangladeshis choose to seek treatment in China will
depend on their experience. The first batch of patients is crucial, as their feedback could influence
future decisions.”
The hospital project falls within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,
which is expected to take necessary initiatives.
Trade and economic collaboration
Bangladesh is exploring opportunities to establish sunset industries—industries in decline in
China—within its territory. 
This move would benefit both nations by creating jobs in Bangladesh while allowing China to
continue profiting from these industries.
Regarding agricultural cooperation, an official said: “As in many countries, the younger
generation in Bangladesh is losing interest in farming. Mechanization is essential for higher
productivity with fewer workers. China has made significant advancements in agricultural
technology, and we could seek assistance in this sector.”
The prospect of launching a direct Chittagong-Kunming flight is also under discussion, with
efforts underway to implement the plan.

Among the many challenges and opportunities unfolding before Bangladesh, the Belt and
Road Initiative looms large. A modern reincarnation of the old Silk Route, this concept
initiated by China also raises concerns, both regionally and internationally. Bangladesh, a
signatory to BRI, has many considerations to factor in as this mega-plan takes shape,

25/05/2025, 10:30 'BRI is a mega plan with deep geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences'
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/roundtable/bri-is-a-mega-plan-with-deep-geostrategic-and-geoeconomic-consequences 1/4These were observations made at the roundtable, ‘Belt and Road Initiative: Connecting the
World’ held on Sunday at a hotel in the capital. Organised jointly by Dhaka Tribune and
Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS), this was a part of a series of
discussions arranged by the two institutions on matters of current national, regional and
international issues.
Going back to the outset, Major General (retd) ANM Muniruzzaman, president of BIPSS,
said that the BRI concept was first floated by the Chinese president Xi Jinping in 2013
while visiting Kazakhstan. President Xi Jinping elaborated this further the next year in
Jakarta. Now 142 countries, including Bangladesh, have signed on to BRI till date.
“The BRI is estimated to cost up to 4 trillion dollars,” Maj Gen (retd) Muniruzzaman
pointed out, terming it as “a mega project, a grand strategy that will have deep
geostrategic and geoeconomic consequences.” Explaining the magnitude of the initiative,
he said, “BRI is structured on six economic corridors, two being corridors with maritime
reach. Bangladesh is on one of the maritime corridors, the BCIM EC (Bangladesh, China,
India and Myanmar Economic Corridor).”
He said that BRI aims to fill the huge infrastructure gap in countries of Asia, including
Bangladesh, as infrastructure is fundamental to the region’s development goals.
Listing the concerns raised about BRI, the BIPSS president said these included possible
debt traps, environmental sustainability of the BRI projects, corruption linked to the
projects in several countries, strategic concerns and so on.
Editor of Dhaka Tribune Zafar Sobhan expressed his view that as Bangladesh had
established its place in the world, BRI had brought both challenges and opportunities to
the fore. He said that this initiative would assist in shaping the geopolitics of the region in
particular, and the world as a whole. Bangladesh, like each signatory of BRI, would have to
take up the initiative to suit its own interests and requirements. He pointed out the need
to discern the pros and cons of BRI and take decisions accordingly.
Speaking as a panelist at the event, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue
(CPD), Fahmida Khatun said that as an emerging economy and a member of BRI, it wasBRI is estimated to cost up to 4 trillion dollars, a mega project, a
grand strategy that will have deep geostrategic and geoeconomic
consequences

As Bangladesh had transformed from a least development country to a developing one,
she pointed out, the country was investing hugely in infrastructure and required
resources. “At present there is a huge gap between what we need and what we get,” she
said, “So we need a flow of investment. In Bangladesh the largest BRI projects were in the
energy and transport sectors and so BRI was meeting the gap.”
Fahmida Khatun also raised several concerns about BRI, including environmental issues
and the use of coal in energy projects, coal being considered the dirtiest energy. Another
concern was the eviction of people from their homesteads to make way for roads and
railways. Even with compensation, people were reluctant to shift from their ancestral
lands. Transparency in the procurement process of many projects was also a matter of
concern.
Assistant professor of economics at East West University and a panelist at the event,
Parvez Karim Abbasi, highlighted the issues lesser discussed about BRI.
Why did BRI come about, he posed the question, explaining that it was about giving the
people an idea of a better tomorrow. Chinese president Xi Jinping had become a most
influential leader and the BRI vision enhanced his image. The confrontation with the West
served to raise his popularity further among his people.
Addressing the concern on debt dynamics, he said that the Chinese way of business was
different from the Western way of business. It had become the financier of last resorts and
spends 85 billion US dollars annually in this regard. There was a huge demand for
infrastructure and loans often became onerous. Chinese used a debt-driven model which
much of the loans being provided by its state-owned banks.
BRI had just emerged from infancy and was in its adolescence, so as to say, Parvez Karim
Abbasi observed.
The discussion was followed by questions, answers and comments by the audience
comprising foreign diplomats, present and former civil servants, retired military officers,
academics, members of the civil society, journalists and others.The Chinese way of business was different from the Western way of

No decision yet on quitting China's Belt and Road: Italy PM
RomeUpdated: 10 Sep 2023, 23: 40 
Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni speaks during a news conference after attending the G20
summit, in New Delhi on 10 September, 2023
Italy has not yet decided whether to quit China's Belt and Road investment plan, Italian
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Sunday, but doing so would not damage bilateral
relations.
""We have yet to make a decision,"" Meloni told a press conference at the close of the G20
summit in New Delhi, a day after meeting for talks with Chinese Premier Li Qiang.
Should Rome decide to quit, it ""would not compromise relations"" with China, Meloni said.AFP
AFP25/05/2025, 10:36 No decision yet on quitting China's Belt and Road: Italy PM
https://en.prothomalo.com/international/p9i2di6ghw 1/3Critics say the Belt and Road plan is a Trojan horse to increase China's influence and
Meloni is under pressure to exit, but hopes to do so without inflaming tensions.
The deal automatically renews in March 2024 unless Italy opts out by the end of this year.
Meloni said the government was ""evaluating the merits"" of being part of the trillion-
dollar investment scheme, which debt-ridden Italy joined in 2019.
It is the only one of the group of leading developed democracies to have signed up.
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said earlier this month that the Belt and Road
initiative ""has not produced the results we were hoping for"".
The Italian PM is tipped to travel to Beijing for a state visit in the next few months, or at
the start of next year, but would not be drawn on a possible date.
""It makes more sense to go to China when we have more elements about our bilateral
cooperation and how to develop it,"" she said.
Meloni's meeting with Li, their first face-to-face, came as a broad alliance of states at the
G20 unveiled ambitious plans to create a modern-day Spice Route linking Europe, the
Middle East and India, which signatories hope will offer a counterbalance to lavish
Chinese infrastructure spending.
Some analysts expect Meloni to pull out of Belt and Road while boosting other existing
Italy-China accords.
The meeting with Li Saturday ""confirmed the common intention to consolidate and
deepen the dialogue between Rome and Beijing on the main bilateral and international
issues,"" Meloni's office said in a statement.
Next year marks the 20th anniversary of a global strategic partnership between the two
countries which ""will constitute the beacon for the advancement of friendship and
collaboration,"" it said.25/05/2025, 10:36 No decision yet on quitting China's Belt and Road: Italy PM

their motherland profoundly, but also made the world a better place. The Chinese path to
modernization presents unparalleled vitality.
Having realized the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all
respects, the Chinese people are now marching in confident strides toward the second centenary
goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects.
The world is facing increasing instability and uncertainty, and the global economy is undergoing
a rocky recovery. Nevertheless, China's economy survives from the harsh pressure by securing its
scale and improving its quality. In the first half of this year, China's GDP exceeded 59.3 trillion
RMB, hitting a year-on-year growth of 5.5 percent, higher than last year's growth rate of 3
percent and outspeeds many other major developed economies during the same period.
The IMF expects China’s economy to expand by 5.2 percent, contributing to the total growth of
world economy by one third. China will remain on a uprising trajectory over the long run and
achieve the steady growth on the track of high-quality development, continuing to inject
confidence and impetus into the global recovery.
Ten years ago, President Xi Jinping raised the vision of building a global community of a shared
future when addressing the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.

Civilization Initiative, as well as jointly building the Belt and Road.
Over the past decade, the vision has been widely acclaimed and recognized by an increasing

across the globe, China has enriched the vision steadily over the past decade, making it an
encompassing platform that shores up growth and unity and offsets unilateralism and hegemony.
The friendly exchanges between China and Bangladesh could be traced back to more than a

strengthen people-to-people interaction and cultural exchanges. To this end, China has introduced
a series of facilitating measures to meet the huge demand for international travels and personnel
exchanges.
For the time being, there are 50 direct flights between Dhaka and Chinese cities on weekly basis,

Foreign adviser’s China tour: 10 extra
years for repaying Chinese loans
Wed Jan 22, 2025 12:00 AM
Last update on: Wed Jan 22, 2025 10:39 AM
Interest rates might be lowered
Beijing has agreed in principle to extend the repayment period for Chinese loans
and assured Dhaka it will look into the request to lower the interest rate to ease
Bangladesh's foreign debt repayment pressure.
Photo: PID
China is Bangladesh's fourth-largest lender after Japan, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank, with total loans disbursed since 1975 coming to $7.5
billion.
The development came yesterday during Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain's
bilateral meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on his four-day tour of
China at the Diaoyuitai State Guest House in Beijing.
At the meeting, Hossain requested lowering the interest rate on Chinese loans
from 2-3 percent to 1 percent, waiving the commitment and management fees
and extending the loan repayment period from 20 years to 30 years for both the
preferential buyer's credit and government concessional loans.
Praising Bangladesh's good track record in repayment, Wang agreed to extend the
maturity period for loans provided to the country and also assured of looking into
the request of lowering the interest rate on the loans, according to a statement
from the Bangladesh foreign ministry.
China places Bangladesh at a very important position in her neighbourhood
diplomacy, the statement said quoting Wang as saying.
Also yesterday, Hossain held a meeting with Luo Zhaohui, the chairman of the
China International Development Cooperation Agency, about Chinese loans.
Hossain requested Luo to ramp up concessional loans and grants and the number
of projects China funds in Bangladesh. Luo responded positively and sought a list
of priority projects from Bangladesh.
Luo said China may consider larger projects in Bangladesh, with some project
funds extended as grants. As a result, the average interest rate of Chinese loans
will go down, he said.
Both sides also discussed the financing of projects in metro rail and the Southern
Infrastructure Development Initiative (SIDI) in Bangladesh.
Over at Hossain's bilateral meeting with the Chinese foreign minister, Beijing
assured of continued duty-free and quota-free access to Bangladeshi products for
three years after graduation from the least-developed country bracket in 2026.
Wang also conveyed China's decision to designate three to four recognised
hospitals in Kunming for treatment of Bangladeshi patients.
He also welcomed Bangladesh's proposal of setting up a specialised tertiary-level
Chinese hospital in Dhaka as a gesture of goodwill on the occasion of the 50th
anniversary of Bangladesh-China diplomatic relations.
Both sides conveyed their readiness to organise a host of activities to mark the
occasion.
Wang requested Bangladesh to consider joining Chinese President Xi Jinping's
three global initiatives: the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security
Initiative and the Global Civilisation Initiative.
In response, Bangladesh conveyed their intention to examine the proposals and
to remain engaged with China in deliberations on the issues.
Wang reaffirmed that China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Bangladesh and reiterated continued Chinese support for the stability, reforms,
democratic transition and development initiatives of Bangladesh.
Recognising Bangladesh's strategic position, the two sides emphasised continued
cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative.
China wants to see Bangladesh's economic development in pace with their own
development and assured China's continued support for the projects conducive to
the livelihood of the people of Bangladesh, Wang said.
The two sides expressed their willingness to work closely on proposed Chinese-
funded projects: the Dasherkandi sewage treatment plant, the upgradation and
modernisation of Mongla Port and the establishment of digital connectivity and
4G expansion.
The Chinese side was very positive about the request for lowering the interest rate
and financial support, an official of the foreign adviser's delegation told the
correspondent from Beijing.
""They have not insisted on their issues of GDI and GSI, but said they want us to be
with them for inclusive development,"" he said.
Bangladesh sought detailed information on China's plan to build a mega-
hydropower dam across the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet.
The Chinese side said they would not consume or withdraw any water and thus
the lower riparian countries will not be affected, the official said, adding that
there was no discussion on the Teesta river management project.
Both leaders discussed the Rohingya crisis and reaffirmed their shared
commitment to work on a roadmap to finding a durable solution to the issue,
according to the foreign ministry statement. Wang reassured China's continued
engagement with Myanmar to address the situation and promote regional
stability.
Hossain reiterated Bangladesh's firm commitment to the 'One China Principle'

Bangladesh and China seem poised to join forces in a new Beijing-sponsored forum styled
Global Development Initiative (GDI) with a massive development programme.
Sources have said the Chinese government sent Bangladesh the final draft of the
memorandum of understanding or MoU on the GDI seeking feedback and confirmation, andBN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bangladesh-vetting-deal-on-joining-gdi-amid-world-reordering 1/7the vetting of its nitty-gritty is in progress.
According to highly placed sources, the draft incorporates some of the comments
forwarded by Bangladesh side earlier.
In lockstep with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is coming up GDI as the latest flagship
development recipe conceived by Chinese President Xi Jinping under which China intends
to support development aspirations of other countries.
Emerging in the wake of current context of what is dubbed reordering of world order from
bipolar through unipolar to multipolar, the forumʼs draft MoU proposes to take China-
Bangladesh strategic cooperative partnership to new highs.
Also envisaged is making full use of Chinese grants, interest- free loans, concessional loans,
and global development and South-South Cooperation Fund, and building regional
flagship projects.
Commenting on the developments a senior official at the finance ministry, who is involved
with the negotiations, told the FE that the government is scrutinising the text of the MoU.
“We have joined the Belt and Road Initiative, so there is no problem in joining the GDI,” he
said, pointing out that implementation of the agreement might take a long time.
International relations analyst Ambassador Humayun Kabir says itʼs logical that, as a
partner of the BRI, Bangladesh will join the GDI.
“But the authorities should be aware of keeping its national interest first in the negotiations
as it had done during the BRI,” he notes.
He also feels that as Bangladesh has shown its willingness to work with all the global
players by simultaneously supporting the US-led Indo-Pacific Strategy and by joining the
China-led BRI and the GDI.
As proposed, the Chinese GDI projects will be implemented through the China international
Development Cooperation Agency, the development arm of the Chinese government.
The proposed MoU entitled ʻStrengthening development cooperation and promotion of
implementation of the global development Initiativeʼ says global development has come to
a critical juncture and developing countries are facing serious challenges in achieving the
UN-designated 2030 Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs.25/05/2025, 11:16 Bangladesh vetting deal on joining GDI amid world reordering | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bangladesh-vetting-deal-on-joining-gdi-amid-world-reordering 2/7“The global development initiative GDI proposed by President Xi Jinping has entered a new
phase of practical cooperation. China and Bangladesh are ready to enhance strategic
alignment, expand development cooperation under the framework of the Global
Development Initiative and take China-Bangladesh strategic cooperative partnership
featuring sincere mutual assistance and lasting friendship to a new level,” the daft deal
reads.
The memorandum proposes active expansion of development cooperation under the
framework of the GDI.
As proposed in the MoU, the two sides will agree to strengthen communication and
coordination jointly implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state,
push for implementation of outcomes in development cooperation, and carry out more
projects to promote economic development and improve peopleʼs livelihood in Bangladesh
so as to deliver tangible benefits to the people of both countries.
It focuses eight priority areas, namely, healthcare, disaster prevention and relief,
connectivity, climate change and green development, digital economy, poverty reduction,
education and active engagement in public in policy dialogue, experience sharing, capacity
building, and practical cooperation.
China is willing to provide support within its capability to facilitate the implementation of
cooperation projects in the eight areas based on the needs of Bangladesh and explore other
potential projects in line with the GDI.
It also aims to establish a consultation mechanism at the director-general or equivalent
level and hold regular online or off-line meetings to gently promote coordinated actions in
development cooperation and identify and address problems in a timely manner so as to
facilitate efficient implementation of projects.
About the tenure of the MoU, the proposal says it shall enter into force upon signature and
remain valid for two years.
But unless either party informs the other in writing for the termination within six months
before the expiry date, this memorandum shall be extended automatically for another two
years, the proposal says, adding that the rule shall prevail for any extension thereafter.
According to the draft, in case of termination the ongoing projects under the memorandum
shall not be affected and shall be continued as per the signed financial agreement for each
individual project.25/05/2025, 11:16 Bangladesh vetting deal on joining GDI amid world reordering | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/bangladesh-vetting-deal-on-joining-gdi-amid-world-reordering 3/7Bangladesh and China started talks on GDI participation last year and gained momentum
after the visit of the then Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yiʼs visit to Dhaka in August 2022,
foreign ministry officials said.
Last week, Chinese envoy in Dhaka Yao Wen said China is willing to work with Bangladesh
to continue exploring cooperation opportunities under the GDI.
The Global Development Initiative, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the General
Debate of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2021, aims to steer
global development toward a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth,
said Chinese officials.
They said the GDI is another major initiative put forward by China after the Belt and Road
Initiative and it is a ʻremobilizationʼ of world development cooperation and a ʻreaffirmationʼ
of the people-oriented concept.
According to Chinese media, since its inception one year ago, the GDI has received warm
responses from the international community, with more than 100 countries having
extended their support to date.

Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen on Saturday said bilateral connectivity projects will feature
""prominently"" during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming meeting with her Indian
counterpart Narendra Modi in New Delhi on the sidelines of the G20 Summit.
""Bangladesh’s connectivity initiatives along the other sides of its borders with India are also
witnessing diverse forms of investment, including the inauguration of a diesel pipeline across the
northern part this year,"" he said while speaking at a seminar on Bangladesh's Indo-Pacific outlook
(IPO).
The government made it clear that Bangladesh's IPO is not aimed at choosing between major
powers, it is rather focused on inclusive development.
The prime minister will attend the G20 summit on September 9-10. There will be a bilateral
meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines.
The US pursues an Indo-Pacific strategy with its allies in the region while China has its Belt and
Road Initiative.
Bangladesh will continue ""to attach priority to regional connectivity in pursuance of our political
leadership’s vision to position our territory as a connectivity hub in the Indo-Pacific context,""
Momen said.
""We are also a part of the Belt and Road Initiative or BRI,"" the foreign secretary added. 
In the critical area of connectivity, he said, Bangladesh remains committed and active on multiple
fronts, including through regional or sub-regional configurations like Saarc, Bimstec and BBIN. 
""In April this year, during her bilateral visit to Japan, our prime minister reaffirmed support to
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s elaboration of the Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth
Belt or BIG-B surrounding Bangladesh and the contiguous parts of Northeastern India.""

said, a sign of the country's deepening influence in Latin America.

The agreement came on the sidelines of a gathering of leaders from the region in

After a meeting on Wednesday morning between Xi and Colombian President
Gustavo Petro, ""the two heads of state witnessed the signing of a cooperation plan

Xi urged the countries to ""take the opportunity of Colombia's formal joining the

cooperation,"" Xinhua said.
Posting a video of the signing to social media platform X, Petro wrote that ""the
history of our foreign relations is changing"".
""From now on, Colombia will interact with the entire world on a footing of

India-China relations will be in focus as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will leave for New Delhi
on a two-day state visit on Friday. 
This will be her second visit to India in less than two weeks and the first incoming bilateral visit
to India by any head of government after the formation of the government in Delhi following the
18th Lok Sabha elections.
Prime Minister Hasina was among the global leaders who attended the swearing-in ceremony of
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union Council of Ministers on June 9.
She will visit Beijing in the second week of July.
In Delhi, she will hold bilateral consultations with Prime Minister Modi and is also scheduled to
call on President Draupadi Murmu and Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar.
External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will call on the Prime Minister after she arrives in Delhi in
the evening.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s Foreign Ministry has remained silent. Unlike other bilateral visits,
there was no curtain-raiser for the media.  The Foreign Ministry did not issue any official
statement about the visit either. Foreign Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud, who has been in Saudi
Arabia as part of his hajj plans, will join the prime minister in Delhi.
The Prime Minister’s Office detailed the itinerary of the visit yesterday. The two leaders will have
a tête-à-tête on Saturday morning before the formal bilateral meeting.
Preparations are underway for at least 10 agreements and MoUs related to energy, connectivity
and economy to be signed after the bilateral meeting. Many of them are due for renewal at the
end of their terms, according to foreign ministry sources. 
Issues of connectivity will be an important element of discussion. The Bangladesh-India
Friendship Bridge is one of the projects to be announced open during the visit. This bridge will
establish a link between Ramgarh in Khagrachhari, and Sabrum in Tripura state.Publish : 21 Jun 2024, 09:00 AM

For a long time, the Teesta water sharing issue has been a topic that comes to the fore during any
visit between India and Bangladesh.
When this visit was planned, the issue was widely discussed despite the lack of an internal
settlement in India that could lead to a solution to it. The Indian central government, at the time
led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, could not sign the deal in 2011 due to the opposition of
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Ms Banerjee, who had been scheduled to travel to
Dhaka as part of Singh’s team, backed out at the last moment, scuttling the effort to resolve the
Teesta issue.
Since the issue has remained pending for a long time and northern Bangladesh faces an acute
shortage of water during the dry season, the government has taken up a Teesta River
Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project which will require about $1 billion for
implementation. China has stepped in to fund the project. However, India has also shown interest
in financing the project.
Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra, during his visit to Dhaka in May to invite the
prime minister, expressed Delhi's interest in the project. This triggered a geopolitical discussion
about which option Bangladesh will go for.
India supported Bangladesh during the Liberation War in 1971 and remains Dhaka’s most trusted
friend. India is also believed to have supported the Awami League government before the January
7 general elections this year when Western countries, particularly the US, were putting pressure
on the government for a “free and fair” election.

On the other hand, in recent years, China has financed major infrastructure projects that the

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/349817/india-china-ties-in-focus-as-pm-hasina-flies-to 3/6The US-based research lab AidData, while analyzing Chinese investment in Bangladesh under
the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) last year said that compared to only $175 million per year
during the BNP era (2002-06), Chinese development financing doubled to $381 million in
Bangladesh during Sheikh Hasina’s first term (2009-14). Since then, it has risen seven-fold to
$2.2 billion (2014-2018) and $2.3 billion (2019-till date).
AidData, housed at William & Mary's Global Research Institute in Virginia, also said that
Bangladesh will likely remain “a key battleground for great power competition” in the coming
years given its unique locational position and recent geopolitical trends.
It’s not zer o-sum game
International relations experts, however, believe that relations with India or China need not be a
zero-sum game.
“We should transform geopolitical conflict into geopolitical cooperation,” Prof Imtiaz Ahmed of
Dhaka University told Dhaka Tribune.
“We always see it as a zero-sum game. But India and China have good relations in several areas.
They work together in BRICS. They are together when it comes to the issue of the Russia,
Ukraine war. Voting on Myanmar issues, both China and India were on the same page in the UN.
Even India’s trade with China also increased. Indian students are now going to China to study
more than to the UK. Then why cannot we cooperate here together?”
He said it is a multi-polar world, and India with its economy, surpassing the UK and France,
would be “polar” in that world; there is no way to stop it.
“Many of the statements of Jaishankar (Indian external affairs minister) regarding the Russia and
Ukraine war went viral as he tried to convince the EU ...‘don’t take us (India) for granted. India
will go with the Indian way’.  So, he tried to push for a new framework. And I want to see
Bangladesh, India relations within that framework,” Prof Imtiaz said.
“I think relations with India need to be innovated. New elements need to be added to the
relations,” he said, as the Teesta water sharing and border killing always take centre stage in
discussions.
“Teesta is not possible because there are 26 live hydropower projects over it in Sikkim and after
all that the amount of water that comes to West Bengal during winter is not sufficient for them.
So, naturally any chief minister of West Bengal will oppose the agreement.
x25/05/2025, 15:13 India-China ties in focus as PM Hasina flies to Delhi Friday
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/349817/india-china-ties-in-focus-as-pm-hasina-flies-to 4/6“At the same time, we are also suffering. Some 102 kilometers out of 115 kilometers of the river
inside Bangladesh dry up during winter. And it’s just the opposite during the rainy season. So,
about 20 million people suffer for that. That’s why the Teesta comprehensive management project
is being planned here by the Bangladesh government.
“But who will bear this huge cost? China showed interest. India also showed interest in this
project. Maybe there is security interest for India if China enters here. Upstream countries always
have diplomatic interest in water. China is also doing that with India when it comes to river
Brahmaputra. I think here we can transform the geopolitical conflicts into geopolitical co-
operation,” he said.
Prof Shahab Enam Khan, at the Department of International Relations of Jahangirnagar
University, also believes that none of the countries are “either-or” options for Bangladesh.
“India, the US, and China each have unique and different roles in Bangladesh. It would be
rational if Bangladesh’s relations with other countries were seen independently,” he said.
“Using a third-country prism in Bangladesh’s bilateral relations undermines the country’s
national interests and growth momentum. China is the largest trading and infrastructure partner,
Japan is the most significant development partner, the US is the most crucial partner in
humanitarian assistance and trade, and the largest investor.
“Bangladesh is India’s largest trade partner in South Asia, providing security support to India in
keeping its northeastern region safe. Bangladesh plays an essential role in the Indian economy
through trade, connectivity from the mainland to its Northeast, and tourism or medical visits.
“Of course, Indian support for the current government is extraordinary, and India plays a crucial
role in supplying essential goods and raw materials. None of these countries is an ‘either-or’
option for Bangladesh,” he said.
“Hence, seeing Bangladesh-China ties from myopic geopolitical or strategic interests won't
positively affect Bangladesh’s economy and security interests. Practically speaking, Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina’s visits to Delhi and Beijing reflect different priorities for the
government,” the JU professor added.

Speakers at a programme on Friday stressed the need for accelerated people to people
exchange between Bangladesh and China.
Education Minister Dr Dipu Moni was the Chief Guest and the new Chinese Ambassador in
Dhaka Yao Wen was the special guest in the programme organised by the Association of
Bangladesh China Alumni (ABCA) to celebrate the Chinese New Year.
Dr Dipu Moni said the history of people to people contact between the two countries is
much older than that of diplomatic ties.
The new Chinese Ambassador emphasised on promotion of solid and steady development
of the bilateral ties between Bangladesh and China.
""Let's join hands together to strive forward with confidence and encourage and promote
the solid and steady development of China Bangladesh cooperation,"" he said while
addressing a function in the city.
""The Chinese New Year is a festival of harmony and cooperation. Harmony is deeply rooted
in Chinese heritage. That's why the Chinese people, while maintaining relations with the
peoples of other countries, always value harmony the most,"" he said.BN25/05/2025, 15:22 Accelerated Bangladesh-China people to people contact stressed | The Financial Express

share this spirit and understanding.
The envoy said that people to people exchanges will intensify in the coming days as China
has lifted Covid restrictions, which were imposed for three years.
""Due to the new policy announced by the Chinese government, travel to China will be much
easier. ""As a result, more air flights will be operational beginning in February,"" he said.
He believes that Bangladesh-China partnership cooperation has enormous potential for
both countries' shared interests and is becoming more open.
Ambassador Munshi Faiz Ahmed moderated the function.

“We are confident that this visit will send a strong signal of openness, cooperation and mutual

adding that the Chinese minister will lead more than 100 Chinese investors to visit Bangladesh at
the end of this month.
During the visit, the two sides will co-host a trade and investment exchange event, where
hundreds of Chinese and Bangladeshi enterprises will engage and explore more cooperation

China's Confucius Institutes (CIs) and Confucius Centers (CCs) found across the globe, are undoubtedly

economic and strategic interests of Beijing in an unobtrusive way .〉Opinion

https://bdnews24.com/opinion/china-funded-confucius-institutes-change-goals-to-suit-local-needs 1/13But in the process of doing so, they have encountered resistance in several countries.
Therefore, the authorities in China have of late been changing the goals and styles of functioning of the CIs
to accord with ground realities.
The changes have resulted in the CIs and CCs now having three objectives: The first of course is to teach
the Chinese language and Chinese culture and prepare the host countries to mentally accept the China-
funded infrastructure projects under the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) .The second is to cater to
specific local demands and needs. And the third is living down the suspicion that the CIs and CCs are not
benign like the American Center or the British Council, but have a hidden political and strategic agenda
impinging on the host countries' sovereignty .
This was revealed at a two-day conference of CIs and CCs from Asian countries held in Colombo on June
27 and 28. It was jointly organised by the CI headquarters in China called ""Hanban' and the universities of
Colombo and Kelaniya both of which host CIs.   There were participants from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,
Nepal, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, and Turkey , besides China.
Origins of CIs
          World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Economy Business Cricket Hello Stripe Recent25/05/2025, 11:08 China-funded Confucius Institutes change goals to suit local needs
https://bdnews24.com/opinion/china-funded-confucius-institutes-change-goals-to-suit-local-needs 2/13As China came out of its shell to be an economic power with global ambitions following the launch of the
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by President Xi Jinping, there was a crying need to make people across the
world aware of China, the Chinese language and Chinese culture. The isolationist policies of the earlier
Maoist era had made China a strange place and its people seem inscrutable. This needed to be corrected
and corrected urgently , given the feverish pace of China's expansion.
It was to ""open"" the world's eyes to China, to inform the world about the cultural underpinnings of the BRI,
and to give the BRI a universal appeal, that President Xi chose to project China as a country based on the
universal appeal of the thoughts of Confucius (551 to 479 BC).
For good reasons, Xi did not pitch on Marxism-Leninism or even ""Chinese socialism"". While the former has
lost its appeal, the latter is but a brand of dictatorship which cannot be showcased abroad.
Confucius' social philosophy , on the other hand, is based primarily on the principle of ""Ren"" or ""loving
others"" while exercising self-discipline. Confucius believed that ""Ren"" could be put into action using the
golden rule: ""What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.""          World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Economy Business Cricket Hello Stripe Recent25/05/2025, 11:08 China-funded Confucius Institutes change goals to suit local needs
https://bdnews24.com/opinion/china-funded-confucius-institutes-change-goals-to-suit-local-needs 3/13According to V en Dhammajothi Thero, Director of the Confucius Institute at Colombo University , Confucius
wanted to make people ""gentlemen"" and not ""sages."" This was because it was practicable to aspire to be a
gentleman and not practical to aim to be a sage. Therefore, Confucianism is a practical and implementable
philosophy which can be accepted across cultures, an ideal basis for making China and its BRI acceptable
globally .

Twelve years ago, the Xi Jinping regime started setting up CIs and CCs primarily to teach the Chinese
language, the philosophy of Confucius, and many aspects of Chinese culture. According to Yu Yunfeng,
Deputy Chief Executive of the Confucius Institute Headquarters and Deputy Director General of Hanban,
there are now 525 CIs and 1,1 13 CCs in 146 countries. And the numbers are growing as the BRI expands
its reach constantly .
As Pang Chunxue, Charge de' Affaires at the Chinese Embassy said, most of the CIs are in countries in
which are on the BRI route. Justifying this, she said: ""The CIs' goal of bringing people together matches the
goals of the BRI which are to narrow gaps in development between countries.""
CIs and CCs have been growing in numbers in Africa with China's increasing economic presence in the
continent. In South Asia, they have acquired a firm foothold in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. Sri Lanka
has two CIs – at the Colombo and Kelaniya Universities. They have only a marginal presence in India
because of New Delhi's entrenched suspicions about Chinese initiatives.
The CIs and CCs are funded by the Chinese government, which also sends and pays the teachers. Each
CI or CC is attached to a Chinese University and each CI has two Directors, one from China and the other
from the host country .Ad          World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Economy Business Cricket Hello Stripe Recent25/05/2025, 11:08 China-funded Confucius Institutes change goals to suit local needs
https://bdnews24.com/opinion/china-funded-confucius-institutes-change-goals-to-suit-local-needs 4/13Responding to local needs
The courses in the CIs and CCs are primarily designed at the Confucius Institute Headquarters in China
called ""Hanban"". But in response to demands from the host countries, the courses have been expanded
beyond language and culture to include subjects of local interest.
For example, in Pakistan, the CIs at the Agriculture University in Faisalabad, has tied up with an
engineering and an agricultural university in Lahore to teach Chinese useful to agriculture and engineering
students.
In Nepal, locals are taught vehicle maintenance not only to learn the trade but to be able to work in Chinese
infrastructure projects in that rugged country said Prof W ang Shengli of the CI in Kathmandu University .
Controversies
But the CIs and CCs have become controversial in some countries. They are suspected to be insidious
institutions primarily meant to brainwash people of the host countries to wean them away from their
entrenched beliefs, and make them think and act like the Chinese, in much the way as Thomas Babington
Macaulay  wanted to ""Anglicise"" Indians in mid-19th Century to make them the backbone of British rule in
India.
This is because of China's sudden rise and its rush to dominate the globe with its economic muscle. The
mushrooming of CIs in the last decade is seen as part being part of a hurriedly pursued expansionist
project.
Speaking at the Colombo conference of CIs, V en Dhammajothi Thero Director of the CI in Colombo
University said: ""The CI headquarters  should make their objectives clear so that there is noAd
Ad          World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Economy Business Cricket Hello Stripe Recent25/05/2025, 11:08 China-funded Confucius Institutes change goals to suit local needs
https://bdnews24.com/opinion/china-funded-confucius-institutes-change-goals-to-suit-local-needs 5/13misunderstanding and suspicions which are voiced in many countries, as in V ietnam. For this, there should
be greater localisation of teaching material and teaching personnel. There should also be a two-way flow
with the course content being 50% Chinese and 50% local.""
The monk, who is a fluent Mandarin speaker , said that he opposes all kinds of globalisation, whether
Western or Chinese, if that would mean the obliteration of  indigenous cultures and thought.
India has allowed CIs but they are not encouraged by the government, even though there is a growing
demand for learning the Chinese language from people trading with China, said Shikha Pandey , Asst.
Professor of Chinese Studies in Mumbai University . ""The Sino-India standof f is standing in the way of the
development of China-studies in India,"" Pandey said.
But most Asian delegates, who came from countries with BRI projects in them, saw the CIs and CCs as
being useful as job providers in BRI projects.
As Ven Dhammajothi said: ""People learn a language to get jobs and people in Sri Lanka need jobs."" Prof
Lakshman Dissanayake, V ice Chancellor of Colombo University noted that it is useful to learn Chinese
given the growing presence of Chinese in Sri Lanka, thanks to the massive infrastructure projects. With a
Free Trade Agreement on the cards, Chinese and Lankan businessmen would need to communicate with
each other and with Chinese tourists pouring in, there would be a need for Chinese knowing interpreters
and guides, he said.
Yu Yunfeng, Deputy Chief Executive of the Confucius Institute Headquarters and Deputy Director General
of Hanban, said that CI top brass are not against improvisation and localisation.
""We are open and broadminded. The CIs are integrating with local communities and are attempting to use
local teachers and local teaching material,"" Yu said.Ad
Ad          World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Economy Business Cricket Hello Stripe Recent25/05/2025, 11:08 China-funded Confucius Institutes change goals to suit local needs
https://bdnews24.com/opinion/china-funded-confucius-institutes-change-goals-to-suit-local-needs 6/13Another of ficial from the CI headquarters, Zheng Menglin, said that the ""CIs belong to all. They help others
to understand China and the Chinese to understand other countries and cultures. Towards those ends
changes are being made,""
Asking people to be patient, Zheng said: ""The CI is only 12 years old and is therefore a teenager
experiencing growing up pains.""
Backing up Yu Yunfeng and Zheng Menglin, Prof Ashfaq Ahmad Chattha of the University of Agriculture,
Faisalabad, Pakistan, said that  the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has created enormous job
opportunities for Pakistani youth, thanks to a bilateral agreement between China and Pakistan which
enjoins Chinese companies to employ qualified locals.
But another Pakistani delegate from Karachi said that Pakistan had to ""fight hard"" to get the Chinese
companies in CPEC to employ local skilled workers because the companies preferred Chinese workers.
G Jimpei, from the CI in Karachi revealed that Chinese companies are not interested in interacting with the
CIs. Perhaps they prefer to bring Chinese labour rather than take local workers.
Another Chinese delegate said that while the CI headquarters might agree to make changes, it might take
some time to get results because the rigid Chinese bureaucracy takes time to think and act dif ferently and
creatively .
The delegate from Bangladesh, Kong Jia Jia alias Prema, a Chinese lady who also speaks fluent Bangla,
said that there is tremendous interest in learning Chinese in Dhaka because of the hope to find jobs in
Chinese projects in Bangladesh and also in China.Ad
Ad          World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Economy Business Cricket Hello Stripe Recent25/05/2025, 11:08 China-funded Confucius Institutes change goals to suit local needs
https://bdnews24.com/opinion/china-funded-confucius-institutes-change-goals-to-suit-local-needs 7/13""The demand is so high that we need more centres. Dhaka is a huge city and we need to open more
centres to cater to people living in far flung areas,"" Prema said.
Flipside to job orientation
But there is flip side to job oriented courses in the CIs and CCs. As Kumar Priyanka Jayasooriya Professor
of Chinese in Kalefniya University said, students who pass out do not come back to teach, even as
volunteers, because they get well-paid jobs in the Chinese companies in the island.
""The reason for this is that university teachers are poorly paid. Because of a lack of qualified teachers we
have to make do with teachers without a post-graduate degree. W e also have to depend on part time
volunteer teachers, and that is reflected in quality ,"" she said.
""One way to get round the problem is to make it mandatory for those who go to China on scholarships to
come back and teach for a set period,"" Jayasooriya suggested.
Most participants wanted China to train more local teachers and also to send more teachers from China to
narrow the huge gap between demand and supply .

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/changes-in-bd-wont-affect-chinas-dev-commitment-envoy 1/6""China sincerely hopes that under the leadership of the interim government, Bangladesh
will carry out state reform, maintain political stability, advance economic development and
improve people's livelihood"", he said while addressing a programme organised to celebrate
the 75th founding anniversary of china .
""China and Bangladesh are traditionally friendly neighbors and comprehensive strategic
cooperative partners. Our bilateral relations are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, with full respect to the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity of
Bangladesh,"" he said adding: ""We believe no one but the Bangladeshi people have the
rights to choose their path of development"".
To support the development of Bangladesh, China will unilaterally open its market and
decides to grant zero-tariff treatment on 100 per cent of taxable items from Bangladesh, he
said.
This facility means China will substantially increase import of cereals, sugar, edible oil,
rubber and rubber products, wood products, jute and jute products, paper and paper
products,wool and cotton from Bangladesh from 1 December 2024, he explains.
""China will also import Bangladeshi fresh Mangos"".
The envoy said to combat the flood, China is about to provide rescue facilities and
equipment to Bangladesh.
""During the last one and a half months since the establishment of the interim government,
the Chinese enterprises have invested more than 85 million US dollars, demonstrating the
confidence China holds for the future development of Bangladesh and our relations"".
Next year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Bangladesh.
Referring to this, Mr Wen said China is looking forward to working closely with Bangladesh
to cement ""our traditional friendship, deepen friendly exchanges and mutually-beneficial
cooperation in various areas, promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, further
advance the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership to a new height.
""Next year is also ""China-Bangladesh Year of People-to-People Exchanges.
""We will come out with dozens of functions in the sectors of political exchanges, economic
and trade cooperation, culture, education, tourism, sports,public health, youth, women,
media, academic interactions,"" he added.

Obaidul Quader asked by foreign reporters about relations
with China and Russia
DhakaPublished: 05 Jan 2024, 19: 34
With one day left for the 12th Jatiya Sangsad election, Awami League called a press
briefing on Friday afternoon at its office in Tejgaon of the capital. A number of foreign
journalists were also present at the briefing, along with local journalists. A foreign
journalist at the briefing asked Obaidul Quader why Bangladesh was maintaining relations
with China and Russia.Staff Correspondent
Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader addresses a press briefing at the party office
in Tejgaon of the capitalAshraful Alam25/05/2025, 10:13 Obaidul Quader asked by foreign reporters about relations with China and Russia
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/w6aflun9rg 1/4The Japanese journalist's question had been, Bangladesh and Japan had strong ties. Japan
had contribution to Bangladesh infrastructural development. At the same time
Bangladesh also had strong ties with China and Russia. How do relations with China and
Russia serve Bangladesh's national interests? What were the benefits of maintaining this
relationship?
In reply, Obaidul Quader said, ""The underlying message of our foreign policy is friendship
towards all and malice towards none. We have friendship with everyone. We have
relations with many countries of the world. Our relations with developed countries are for
our development. We have ties with certain countries for infrastructural development,
such as India, Japan, China, Russia and France. Japan is funding the metro rail. We should
not differentiate. Friends are friends. Everyone is our friend.""
The Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader answered several questions from
local and foreign journalists at the press briefing of the party. Obaidul Quader even alleged
that some of the journalists' questions were biased.
When asked whether the election would be recognised at home and abroad, Obaidul
Quader replied, ""Let the election take place first. The foreigners will say whether it was
credible or not. I have said that the turnout and participation will be satisfactory. There
will be a good election is the country. We regret that the major opposition won't be there.
If BNP had been there, the election would have been more competitive, we admit. But even
so, the election is still competitive.""
The foreign press has reported that a one-sided election is about to be held in Bangladesh
because the major opposition is boycotting it. When asked to comment on this, Obaidul
Quader said, ""A one-sided election is not being held here, it is a one-sided opposition.""
BNP has alleged that the government is staging a dummy election. Now an attempt is
being made to bring forward dummy voters to make it seem credible to the foreign
quarters. When asked about this, Obaidul Quader responded that BNP itself was a dummy
party. BNP is the dummy party of Bangladesh.The US has made it clear in which areas they will impose sanctions.
BNP and its like-minded allies are clearly impeding the election now.
We want to know from the US why there are not imposing sanction,
their visa policy now?
Obaidul Quader, AL general secretary25/05/2025, 10:13 Obaidul Quader asked by foreign reporters about relations with China and Russia
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/w6aflun9rg 2/4BNP has said they will not resist the election. At the same time, they have called for a
hartal (general strike). Is this not contradictory? It was reported that BNP's programmes
are being carried out at the prescription of the US embassy. In reply to the question in this
regard, Obaidul Quader said, ""Why are you asking biased questions. This is too biased.""
A journalist said, people's perception is that Awami League is about to ascend to power for
the fourth consecutive time. How many seats does Awami League think it will win? People
have another perception that Awami League's independent candidates will win more. Who
do you think will make up the opposition?
Replying, Obaidul Quader said, ""We will InshaAllah win the election. I do not want to say
now how many seats we will win. And the election results will tell who the opposition will
be.""
When asked what percentage of the votes Awami League hoped for in this election,
Obaidul Quader said, ""All I will say is that the voter turnout will be satisfactory."" When
asked about BNP's hartal on election day, he said, ""Hartal is an outdated rusty tool for any
movement. BNP used this rusty tool before too, to no avail. There is no need to think it will
work in the future either.""
BNP is trying to disrupt the election with the hartal. So will the US imposed sanctions on
BNP? In reply, Obaidul Quader said, ""The US has made it clear in which areas they will
impose sanctions. BNP and its like-minded allies are clearly impeding the election now.
We want to know from the US why there are not imposing sanction, their visa policy
now?""
Will voter turnout be affected by BNP's hartal? If so, what measures will Awami League
take to bring the voters to the polling centres? In reply, Obaidul Quader said, ""There are
no special arrangements to bring voters to the polling centres. During elections it is seen
that the leaders and activists have teams to bring the voters to the centres. They will do
that. Most of the voters will come spontaneously, on their own accord. Those who delay
may perhaps we requested to come sooner. Our teams will do that.""25/05/2025, 10:13 Obaidul Quader asked by foreign reporters about relations with China and Russia

Speakers at a programme on Friday stressed the need for accelerated people to people
exchange between Bangladesh and China.
Education Minister Dr Dipu Moni was the Chief Guest and the new Chinese Ambassador in
Dhaka Yao Wen was the special guest in the programme organised by the Association of
Bangladesh China Alumni (ABCA) to celebrate the Chinese New Year.
Dr Dipu Moni said the history of people to people contact between the two countries is
much older than that of diplomatic ties.
The new Chinese Ambassador emphasised on promotion of solid and steady development
of the bilateral ties between Bangladesh and China.
""Let's join hands together to strive forward with confidence and encourage and promote
the solid and steady development of China Bangladesh cooperation,"" he said while
addressing a function in the city.
""The Chinese New Year is a festival of harmony and cooperation. Harmony is deeply rooted
in Chinese heritage. That's why the Chinese people, while maintaining relations with the
peoples of other countries, always value harmony the most,"" he said.BN25/05/2025, 15:22 Accelerated Bangladesh-China people to people contact stressed | The Financial Express

share this spirit and understanding.
The envoy said that people to people exchanges will intensify in the coming days as China
has lifted Covid restrictions, which were imposed for three years.
""Due to the new policy announced by the Chinese government, travel to China will be much
easier. ""As a result, more air flights will be operational beginning in February,"" he said.
He believes that Bangladesh-China partnership cooperation has enormous potential for
both countries' shared interests and is becoming more open.
Ambassador Munshi Faiz Ahmed moderated the function.

Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen on Wednesday said that cooperation in the military
and security fields has always been a cornerstone of China-Bangladesh relations and it has
yielded significant achievements in recent years.
“China is willing to work with Bangladesh to actively implement the consensus reached by
the leaders of the two countries, further strengthen exchanges at various levels between
the two armed forces, and deepen cooperation in defense industry and trade, training,
equipment and technology, mutual visits of navy ships, and the UN peacekeeping
operations” the envoy said while delivering a lecture at the National Defense College (NDC)
in Bangladesh.
Lieutenant General Md Akbar Hossain, commandant of NDC, along with more than 70
officers of Bangladeshi Armed Forces and representatives of foreign armies, was present at
the programme, a spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy said.
Ambassador Yao said that China puts forward the Global Security Initiative, and advocates
for the establishment of a security concept that emphasises a common, comprehensive,
cooperative, and sustainable approach. In terms of the military, China pursues a national
defense policy that is defensive by nature.
“While resolutely safeguarding its own national sovereignty, security and development
interests, China aims at building a global community with a shared future. Hegemony,
expansion or spheres of influence find no place in Chinese dictionary,” he added.
At the end of the lecture, Ambassador Yao had friendly interactions with the audience on

China wants to implement a free trade agreement with Bangladesh by 2026, said Yao Wen
Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka on Thursday.
“We are in the stage of feasibility studies, but weʼre looking forward. It will be completed by
the end of this year. After feasibility studies, we will go to the stage of physical negotiations.
So our objective is that by the year 2026, there will be free trade arrangements betweenBN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/china-wants-fta-with-bangladesh-by-2026 1/9China and Bangladesh,” the envoy said, responding to a question on how to bridge the
huge trade imbalance, which is tilted towards China.
The question-and-answer session took place following a seminar on the ʻBelt and Road
Initiativeʼ jointly organised by the Chinese Embassy and the Diplomatic Correspondents
Association of Bangladesh (DCAB).
Expressing his views on bridging the trade deficit, he said that China doesnʼt want a single
surplus from Bangladesh.
“The imbalance exists due to the structure of the trade, so we have to find a way out to
remove this imbalance,” he said, adding, ""FTA is one of the ways to narrow down the
deficit.""
He also mentioned that Chiba has raised investment in Bangladesh, through which the
trade imbalance can be reduced.
“We want more investment in the manufacturing sector of Bangladesh. So we encourage
Chinese companies to invest in ICT, food processing, renewable or new energy, and other
new sections so that it can have better capacity to diversify exports” he stated, adding “In
this way, we can reduce the imbalance, and that is the main objective”.
The Chinese envoy also said that as a friend of Bangladesh and as a country with a large
amount of investments, enterprises, and personnel in Bangladesh, China sincerely hopes
that all stakeholders in Bangladesh would take the fundamental interests of the people into
full consideration, properly resolve their differences, and jointly maintain political and
social stability.
“This year is the pre-election year in Bangladesh. Many friends from the media have come
to ask me what is Chinaʼs observations are on the current political situation in Bangladesh. I
want to underscore that the upcoming election is an internal affair of Bangladesh. As a
matter of foreign policy, China adheres to the principle of non-interference in the internal
affairs of other countries and opposes any force interfering in the internal affairs of other
countries,” he said.
He said the future of Bangladesh would be determined by the people of Bangladesh.
Asked what kind of election China wants to see in Bangladesh, as many countries have
already been suggesting their views, the Chinese Ambassador said, “Bangladeshʼs election
is its internal matter.  Our policy is very clear; you know, weʼre not intervening, but we do
hope that after the election there will be stability, life will return to normalcy and our
cooperation will continue. Definitely, that is our conviction.”25/05/2025, 11:46 China wants FTA with Bangladesh by 2026 | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/china-wants-fta-with-bangladesh-by-2026 2/9“And I want to say to the people who have been fighting for democracy in the last 50 years
since establishment of Bangladesh, so I believe all of us know what sort of democracy you
need.”
“And thatʼs my conviction that the election will be conducted in the parameters of
constitution and law.”
Asked whether China, like some other countries, will call for dialogue among the political
parties, he said, itʼs the political parties that can answer the question, not he.
“But hopefully, we just want to see, you know, that the differences can be bridged,  the
uncertainty can be gotten rid of, lives can get back to normal, and political and social
stability will remain,” he said.
Responding to comments on the blockades and hartals and their impact on Chinese
nationals living here, the Ambassador said Chinese investors are keen to invest in
Bangladesh and they want to see stability.
“China wants to see that over 20,000 Chinese nationals living in Bangladesh and Chinese
properties are protected, he said, adding that so far, all Chinese people and assets here are
properly protected by the authorities.
He said, “We feel safe so far. But as you mentioned, we sincerely hope that the uncertainty
and all this violence, you know, can be over.
“So, all the stakeholders or political parties will settle their differences and maintain
political and social stability together, taking the fundamental interests of the people of
Bangladesh into consideration.”
The Chinese envoy said that both the countries are eager to settle bilateral trade through
local currencies, and initial experiments are underway in this regard.
Responding to a question, he said that if Bangladesh sought help from China to address
foreign exchange challenges, his country would stand by Bangladesh to resolve the issue.
Responding to a question on Rohingya repatriation, the envoy said that China hopes to see
the implementation of a pilot repatriation of Rohingyas by December to start a process of
sustainable repatriation.
On BRI, Mr Wen said that over the past decade, the BRI has gotten off the ground, grown
rapidly, and produced fruitful outcomes.
rd25/05/2025, 11:46 China wants FTA with Bangladesh by 2026 | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/china-wants-fta-with-bangladesh-by-2026 3/9“The 3 Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation concluded last month was of a
great success. A total of more than 10,000 representatives from 151 countries and 41
international organisations took part in the Forum. Once again, the BRI demonstrated its
tremendous appeal and global influence. In his keynote speech, Chinese President Xi
Jinping underscored that mankind is an interdependent community of shared destiny.”
He noted that on the journey of Belt and Road cooperation, China and Bangladesh have
always been good friends with mutual trust and good partners in seeking common
development.
He mentioned that over the past seven years, China has built 12 highways, 21 bridges and
27 power and energy projects in Bangladesh, contributing to turning the dreams of the
Bangladeshi people into reality.
Over the past seven years, the stock of Chinese investment in Bangladesh has grown from
USD 241 million to nearly USD 1.4 billion, Mr Wen mentioned, adding that at present, there
are nearly 700 Chinese enterprises operating in Bangladesh.
“These enterprises are active practitioners deeply cultivating in Bangladesh. They assume
social responsibilities in Bangladesh and make significant contributions to economic
development, environmental protection, community services, public welfare and charity by
creating more than 550,000 jobs in Bangladesh”.
“Last week, the Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone (CEIZ) in Chittagong was officially
launched, and the enterprises held a ceremony of signing documents of investment
intention. It is the first Chinese industrial zone in Bangladesh and a trail-blazing
achievement,” he added.
The envoy pointed out that on the journey of Bangladeshʼs modernisation, the BRI is the
most compatible and befitting development cooperation initiative with Vision 2041 and
Smart Bangladesh.
China stands ready to work with Bangladesh to tighten the ties of cooperation and embrace
a new stage of Belt and Road cooperation of higher quality at a higher level, he mentioned.
“We shall fully leverage our economic complementarity and strengthen cooperation on
infrastructure development, ICT, new energy, agriculture and so on, thereby ushering in the
next golden decade of Belt and Road cooperation.”
About Chinese policy on the ongoing Middle East conflict, he said, “Unfortunately, the
recent escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict plunged the Middle East into war once25/05/2025, 11:46 China wants FTA with Bangladesh by 2026 | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/china-wants-fta-with-bangladesh-by-2026 4/9again. In just one month, more than 10,000 civilians have died in the Gaza Strip, the inferno
on earth.""
“The UN should play its due role in resolving the question of Palestine. The UN Security
Council needs to shoulder important responsibilities for this, build international consensus
as quickly as possible, and take real measures to that end.
“The root cause of the question of Palestine lies in the long delay in realising the dream of
an independent State of Palestine and the failure to redress the historical injustice suffered
by the Palestinian people. Israel has the right to statehood, so does Palestine. The answer
to the question is a two-state solution and an independent State of Palestine,” he said,
highlighting the Chinese stance on the issue.
On the Rohingya issue, he said, all stakeholders have increasingly become aware that
repatriation is the only long-term and most effective solution to the crisis. This year, by far,
under the mediation of China, Bangladesh and Myanmar have reached an important
consensus on the early initiation of repatriation. Officials from the two sides have
maintained frequent and direct talks in this regard.
“With joint efforts, we managed two rounds of “come & talk” missions by Myanmar officials
and one “go & see” mission to Rakhine State by representatives of the displaced people and
Bangladeshi officials. In this process, the displaced people gradually built up and enhanced
confidence towards repatriation.”
China has also kept close contact with UN agencies and ASEAN states and called upon the
international community to extend understandings and support to Bangladesh and
Myanmar so as to create proper conditions for the early initiation of repatriation, he said.
President of the Chinese Enterprise Association in Bangladesh Mr Ke Changliang gave a
presentation on the Chinese projects in Bangladesh.
Responding to a question, he said land acquisition remains a major challenge in
implementing mega projects in Bangladesh. But the things are improving.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/350202/liu-jianchao-china-ready-to-align-bri-with 1/4Dhaka-Beijing relations are “entering a new development stage” following the elections in
Bangladesh, and China is ready to align its flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Vision 2041 of becoming a developed country.
“The relationship with Bangladesh is always one of the priorities in China’s neighborhood
diplomacy, which is making steady progress under the guidance of leaders of the two countries,”
visiting  Chinese minister of the international affairs department of the Communist Party Liu
Jianchao said on Tuesday at a dialogue.
The Chinese Embassy in Dhaka hosted the event, styled “Looking Towards the Future of China-
Bangladesh Relations: A Conversation with the CPC Delegation”, at the Renaissance Hotel in the
capital. 
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen moderated the dialogue that brought together
leaders of the Bangladesh Awami League and its associate bodies, BNP, Jatiya Party, JaSod, and
Workers Party, as well as representatives from the business, academic, and media communities.
Liu Jianchao comes to Dhaka for the first time ahead of the prime minister’s bilateral visit to
Beijing from July 8-11.
He said the prime minister’s visit will help uplift the relationship, engaging in new areas of
cooperation for mutual benefit.
“China is always committed to sharing development opportunities with Bangladesh. The Chinese
Dream and Sonar Bangla do dovetail with each other and can enable each other’s success,” he
said, as Bangladesh was the first country in South Asia to sign the MoU for the flagship BRI
during the visit of President Xi Jinping in 2016.""
“Fourteen major infrastructure projects under the BRI framework have been put to use or made
phased progress including Padma Bridge, Dasher Gandhi Sewerage Treatment Plant, and
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel,” the visiting minister said.
“These projects have delivered tangible benefits to our two peoples and served as a firm basis for
our further cooperation. China will stay committed to higher-level opening up to countries around
the world including Bangladesh,” he said.
He visited the Padma Bridge and called it a “flagship project” of the Belt and Road Initiative.
He paid tribute to Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at the
Bangabandhu Memorial Museum. He met President Mohammed Shahabuddin, Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina and Foreign Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud.25/05/2025, 14:17 Liu Jianchao: China ready to align BRI with Bangladesh’s Vision 2041
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/350202/liu-jianchao-china-ready-to-align-bri-with 2/4China praises Bangladesh as key
partner ahead of PM Hasina's visit
He also attended a donation event under the China-Bangladesh Healthy Children Initiative held in
the Jamia Islamia Arabia Madrasa and Orphanage in Bhashantek.
Liu Jianchao highlighted Bangladesh’s socio-economic progress and said “as a friendly neighbor
with a shared culture, China salutes and congratulates Bangladesh on its achievements.”
“The relationship with Bangladesh is always one of the priorities in China’s neighborhood
diplomacy, which is making steady progress under the guidance of the leaders of the two
countries.”
“Since the establishment of our diplomatic ties, we have always respected, trusted and supported
each other no matter how the international landscape evolved,” he said.
“Our relationship has emerged even stronger and become a paradigm of equality, mutual benefit
and harmonious coexistence between the two neighbors. The relations elevated to the strategic
cooperation partnership in 2016 when President Xi visited Bangladesh.""
“Going forward we stand ready to work with Bangladesh for the alignment between the BRI and
Vision 2041 and the proposal of development of the southern region,” he said.
“Efforts will be made to deepen our cooperation in infrastructure, digital economy, clean energy,
climate response and industrial upgrading. Our goal is to provide more support and pathways for
Bangladesh to achieve sustainable and resilient development, create more highlights in China-
Bangladesh cooperation, and boost people’s sense of involvement, fulfillment and happiness in
our cooperation,"" said Liu Jianchao. 
CPC’ s global principles
He also highlighted his party CPC’s activities both domestically and internationally and said they
uphold three major principles while conducting different types of exchange programmes.
“First, we never draw ideological lines and that is why we have friends all over the world.
Second, we develop relations with political parties no matter if they are in office or not. That is
why we have so many true friends and old friends. Third, we are committed to seeking common
ground while reserving differences, respecting each other and learning from each other.”25/05/2025, 14:17 Liu Jianchao: China ready to align BRI with Bangladesh’s Vision 2041
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/350202/liu-jianchao-china-ready-to-align-bri-with 3/4“Therefore, we can engage in candid exchanges with friendly parties on the challenges and
experience in state and party governance.”
A 50-member delegation of the ruling Awami League and its affiliate bodies recently visited
China. Another delegation at the party’s senior level will also visit soon after the Prime Minister’s
visit.
Ventur e new ar eas of partnership
Executive Director of the Center for Alternatives Prof Imtiaz Ahmed suggested venturing into
new areas of partnership between the countries.
He particularly suggested education sector collaboration, joint research, and innovation involving
youths of both Bangladesh and China.
“I say this because knowledge production in the multipolar world cannot be in silos. Education is
also ought to be multipolar. Technology allows us to do that,” he said.
“It’s important to link at the primary school level, not the tertiary level because by the time we
enter the tertiary level, our mind gets loaded with a lot of things and we don’t change. Schools in
China and Bangladesh can get connected now. We have that kind of technology,” he said,
recommending a pilot project by getting 10 Bangladeshi schools connected with China.

PM’s visit to China: Dhaka to seek $20b
fresh loans from Beijing
Thu Jul 4, 2024 12:00 AM
Last update on: Tue Jul 9, 2024 07:49 PM
Bangladesh will seek fresh loans amounting to $20 billion during Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit to China, which Beijing hopes would be a ""game
changer"" in the bilateral relationship.
Of the sum, $15 billion would be for infrastructure projects and $5 billion --
which would be disbursed in yuan -- would be to facilitate payments for imports
from China, according to the officials involved in preparing the proposals.দ ুই পরাশর  মােঝ  বাংলােদশ , কীভােব  ভারত  আর  চীনেক  বােলন্স  করেব ? | China-Ba দ ুই পরাশর  মােঝ  বাংলােদশ , কীভােব  ভারত  আর  চীনেক  বােলন্স  করেব ? | China-Ba ……
""We have reached consensus on several aspects but are yet to finalise it -- we will
finalise it by July 7,"" one of the officials told The Daily Star yesterday.
The foreign ministry yesterday held an inter-ministerial meeting for finalising the
joint statement that will be adopted by Bangladesh and China during the PM's
visit from July 8 to July 11.
The visit comes just two weeks after Hasina's first state visit to India after she was
sworn in as the PM for a fourth straight term.
The trip to China, Bangladesh's largest trading partner, is viewed as a balancing
act by Hasina, who hopes to be in the good books of two competing regional
powers.
Bangladesh will seek Chinese support for the Southern Integrated Development
Initiative (SIDI) centring the Payra Port in Patuakhali, according to finance
ministry officials.
This will be an integrated development plan for the southern region involving
projects on transport and communication, ICT, power and energy, logistics and a
special economic zone.
SIDI will see the establishment of an electric vehicle plant, a hi-tech park and a
logistic hub at a strategic location, said a finance ministry official.Japan is
supporting the Moheshkhali-Matarbari Integrated Infrastructure Development
Initiative (MIDI) and the BIG-B Initiative (The Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth
Belt).
""Similarly, Dhaka wants Beijing to support SIDI,"" said a foreign ministry official.
Bangladesh earlier sought a loan in Yuan worth $5 billion to facilitate importers
to make payments for goods and services procured from China amid Bangladesh's
strained dollar stockpile.
Bilateral trade between Bangladesh and China stands at $23 billion, with imports
by Bangladesh accounting for almost the entire sum.
A team of Chinese Exim Bank yesterday met with officials of the Economic
Relations Division, the finance ministry wing that negotiates foreign loans, to
discuss the terms and conditions for the loan, The Daily Star has learnt from
officials informed with the proceedings.

Dhaka looks to Beijing for fresh loans
The other projects for which Dhaka will be seeking loans from China include: the
Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Development Project (Line 2), the Bhanga-Kuakata rail
line, bridge over the Kocha river at Pirojpur, the renovation of Dhaka Medical
College Hospital, Maheshkhali/Matarbari Bakhrabad 3rd parallel gas
transmission pipeline.
An announcement on starting negotiations for a free trade agreement may also
come up during the visit as Bangladesh is eager to boost exports to China to
reduce the trade gap.
Beijing wants to upgrade the relationship with Dhaka to a ""comprehensive
strategic cooperative partnership"" from ""strategic partnership"" that was declared
during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2016, according to officials
involved with the proceedings.
Stakeholders, however, advised putting national interests at the centre of the
negotiations.
Bangladesh wants to sign FTAs or other deals with China but it needs to negotiate
efficiently to serve the national interests, said Rumana Islam, a commissioner of
the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission.
""We have a number of bilateral trade treaties, but mostly they protect the
interests of the foreign investors. They don't speak much about Bangladesh's
interests,"" she said at a roundtable on the future of China-Bangladesh relations
organised by the Bangladesh Foundation for Regional Studies yesterday.
China can support Bangladesh in the development of state-of-the-art hospitals
that are in high demand here, said Imtiaz Ahmed, executive director of the Centre
for Alternatives.
""Several lakh Bangladeshis go abroad for treatment every year, a trend that could
be reversed with Chinese investment in the health sector,"" he said.
There are opportunities for China, India and other countries to work on the
Teesta project.
""It is important that the Teesta project implementation begins soon as 29 million
people are suffering because of the water deficit in the Teesta. It is time for us to
turn geopolitical conflicts into cooperation,"" Ahmed said at the event moderated
by Shah Ali Farhad, a former special assistant to Hasina.

Belt and Road initiative: B angladesh perspective

One of the recent initiatives that warrants heightened attention and importance is China's
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the proposal to build the Silk Road Economic Belt
and the 21st  Century Maritime Silk Road or BRI in a bid to revive the historic trade route by
boosting cooperation between China and other Asian nations.BN
25/05/2025, 11:21 Belt and Road initiative: Bangladesh perspective | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/belt-and-road-initiative-bangladesh-perspective-1554478224 1/9Both the New Silk Road and New Maritime Silk Road are proactive moves to extend China's
infrastructure development programmes backed by its plenty of money and enormous
expertise. China has clearly demonstrated in recent years its most remarkable performance
in infrastructure development in Asia. Moreover, Chinese ideas have some unique
attributes which could potentially bring significant benefits to the participating countries
through deepening of economic co-operation and integration by leveraging on three
connectivity: transport connectivity, trade connectivity and investment connectivity.
We are observing that China is constantly changing. Comrade Xi Jinping's China has taken a
more active role in international relations and moved away from Comrade Deng Xiaoping's
policy of ""Keeping a low profile"" to Comrade Xi Jinping's paradigm of striving for
achievements. It is in the context of this shift that China proposed the BRI and has
employed more globally-oriented slogans - like ""Shared destiny for all mankind"" -  to
describe its flagship foreign policy initiative. The fact that China is now confident enough to
propose a project addressing ""all mankind"" highlights the extent of the foreign policy shift.
China now finds itself in ""a key period for realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
Nation"" and is more confident and more competent than any time in the history"" to grasp
the ""historic opportunity"".
At the Belt and Road Forum, President Xi noted that ""In pursuing the Belt and Road
Initiative, we should focus on the fundamental issue of development, release the growth
potential of various countries and active economic integration and inter-connected
development and deliver benefits to all"". The BRI is an umbrella initiative which covers a
multitude of investment projects designed to promote the flow of goods, investment and
people. In March, 2015 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China disseminated an action plan
that fleshed out specific policy goals of BRI. These include -
 Improving intergovernmental communication to better align high-level government
policies like economic development strategies and plans for regional co-operation;
 Strengthening the co-operation of infrastructure plans to better connect hard
infrastructure networks like transportation systems and power grids;
 Encouraging the development of soft infrastructure such as the signing of trade deals,
aligning of regulatory standards and improving financial integration;
 Bolstering people-to-people connections by cultivating students, experts and cultural
exchanges and tourism.
Beneficiary countries are likely to find the most attractive elements of the BRI to be its
provision and hard infrastructure. Likewise, BRI provides China with an opportunity to
finance these infrastructure projects around the world.25/05/2025, 11:21 Belt and Road initiative: Bangladesh perspective | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/belt-and-road-initiative-bangladesh-perspective-1554478224 2/9In September last year, the Chinese government issued guidelines for official translation of
the initiative as ""Belt and Road "" rather than ""One Belt One Road"". This highlights a process
whereby the initiative has become more inclusive with time; previously the two
components were sub-regional and now the term is a global one that leaves elasticity for
China to interpret according to its views. The call on Latin American countries to take part
in the initiative is a proof that China is beginning to think beyond the old Silk Road and is
planning to shape a new one.
China experts may interpret BRI as China's new geopolitical and economic strategy - a plan
in the face of an American pivot to Asia.
Leaving the ""Keeping a low profile"" strategy behind and aiming to play a more
consequential role in international affairs, China needed to re-brand its growth in the eyes
of other countries as an opportunity rather than a threat. This in turn allows China to
continue to grow and accumulate power within the international system. BRI could be seen
as the vehicle through which that transition occurs. BRI buys China more time to develop
economically and to slowly shift the global balance of power in its favour.
Another interpretation would be BRI as a vision for a new wave of globalisation - one that
can be defined without the historical baggage that the term possesses in the aftermath of 
the rise of populism and protectionism in the west and President Donald Trump's rhetoric
in particular. This helps China to promote itself as the main engine of globalisation.
President Xi Jinping's speech in Davos in 2017 clearly contrasted with President Trump's
rhetoric and encapsulates this new narrative for China's role in global affairs.
Consequently, BRI could be viewed as a Chinese vision of ""making our planet great again"",
borrowing President Macron's slogan. And BRI's goal of achieving a community of ""Share
destiny for all mankind"" would mean shaping a new vision for globalisation with Chinese
characteristics which is likely to be distinct from one led by the US after the Second World
War.
The present democratic government of Bangladesh under the dynamic and visionary
leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been working relentlessly to bring about a
positive change in the country and the region. Bangladesh has set a target to become a
middle-income country and graduate from the LDC status by 2021 and become a developed
country by 2041. The country has been a strong believer in regional connectivity, and given
its unique geopolitical position, it can derive enormous benefits from regional connectivity
like BCIM-EC. Connectivity through road, rivers and railways is perceived as an economic
necessity and constitutes a part of the service industry. The ability to construct the New Silk
Route which is reflected now by Belt and Road will depend on the development of a25/05/2025, 11:21 Belt and Road initiative: Bangladesh perspective | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/belt-and-road-initiative-bangladesh-perspective-1554478224 3/9coherent strategy by all countries involved, and must take into account key geopolitical and
security considerations.
The Belt and Road initiative is an incredibly ambitious plan that may reshape global trade,
particularly regional one. As financial cooperation within the region deepens, this heart of
modern economy is providing steady impetus to the Belt and Road. Bangladesh strategised
its policy by taking cognizance of the evolving scenario and advantage of the emerging
possibilities. In this backdrop, BCIM-EC and BCIM-wide economic co-operation and
integration could prove to be an important opportunity in the transformative journey that
Bangladesh aspires to undertake over the near to medium-term future. Let us seize this
opportunity of BCIM-EC by working together to establish a harmonious South Asia for the
region in general and for the four countries of this bloc in particular.

economy aspirations,” he said. Strategically, it is significant for maritime security amid naval
expansions by emerging powers. Environmentally, the bay faces climate change and
environmental protection challenges. Geopolitically, it is a platform for regional cooperation and
competition.
Rear Admiral ASM A Awal (retd) discussed the strategic significance of the Bay of Bengal within
the Indian Ocean region. He emphasized the need for substantial investment and a comprehensive
restructuring approach to harness the blue economy's potential.
In his remarks, Shafqat Munir, senior fellow at BIPSS, highlighted that Bangladesh is
increasingly developing its identity as a maritime nation. He provided some examples of
historical cooperation between the UK and Bangladesh in the realm of security and the ties that
existed between the Bangladesh Armed forces and the UK armed forces. He also mentioned that
there is an urgent need for capability development to address Bangladesh’s emerging maritime
security needs and the United Kingdom could be an important partner in that regard. Munir also
talked about the increasing geostrategic competition in the maritime domain and Bangladesh’s
growing importance as a maritime player.
Commodore Syed Misbah Uddin Ahmed, director general of BIMRAD, underscored that
maritime security and strategy are interconnected with land-based operations. He also talked
about the external influence in the Bay of Bengal. The Bay is also important for implementation
of Chinese BRI corridor. Therefore the potential for entrance into the bay from other areas have
got to be understood.
Dr Manzur Haque, honorary advisor to Bangladesh Institute of Maritime Research and
Development (BIMRAD) discussed the challenges faced in constructing the Matarbari deep sea
port and the implications of Chinese presence in Hambantota. Group Captain Zahidul Islam Khan
(retd) emphasized the importance of governance in the Bay of Bengal and the necessity of having
Western-origin hardware to build governance capacity. And Parvez Karim Abbasi focused on
Bangladesh's vulnerabilities in maritime security. He stressed the need for resources and
partnerships with like-minded countries to fulfill the aspiration of becoming a net security
provider.
Ayesha Kabir, head of Prothom Alo-English highlighted non-traditional security issues in the bay,
including climate change, natural disasters, terrorism, refugees, narcotics piracy, unregulated
fishing, rising sea levels, and salinity.

such as India, China, Japan, France, and Russia in the region. He noted India's particular
understanding and strategic approach to the Bay of Bengal. 
The moderator added to that the Bay of Bengal serves as a critical space for Indian naval
operations, influencing both India's security and regional stability. He also highlighted about
China's increasing interest in the bay and the Indian Ocean and the consequent geopolitical
tensions.
Marjuka Binte Afzal, a lecturer from Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP), discussed
traditional security concerns in the Bay of Bengal and highlighted Bangladesh's absence from
naval exercises in the bay. She emphasized the importance of information sharing. 
While questioning about the health of the Bay of Bengal, the moderator pointed out the many
ways the marine space is being polluted through plastic pollution, acidification and excessive
heating of the sea. Rear Admiral Awal recognized the ecological aspect of the bay as a huge
challenge. The Bay of Bengal has a rich marine eco-system. In order to protect the diverse
biodiversity of the Bay of Bengal and its surroundings we need specific action, collaboration and
huge investment.
The roundtable concluded with a unanimous recognition of Bangladesh as a maritime nation, a
crucial acknowledgement of the country's extensive coastline and significant maritime resources.
This recognition is not merely symbolic; it reflects the deep-seated realities of Bangladesh’s
geography, economy, and strategic imperatives. The discussions underscored the necessity for
Bangladesh to adopt a maritime-centric approach in its policy-making and strategic planning.
This approach involves prioritizing maritime issues in national agendas, investing in the maritime
sector, and enhancing naval capabilities to protect and leverage maritime resources effectively. 
Enhancing maritime security was identified as a cornerstone for maintaining stability in the Bay
of Bengal. The experts emphasized that robust maritime security measures are essential to
safeguard against a range of threats. Strengthening the Bangladesh Navy and Coast Guard,
improving surveillance and intelligence capabilities, and fostering international naval cooperation
were highlighted as critical steps in this direction. Moreover, fostering regional cooperation was
deemed pivotal for achieving both security and economic aspirations. 
These cooperative efforts could take the form of joint naval exercises, information sharing, and
coordinated responses to maritime challenges. By adopting a maritime-centric policy approach,
enhancing security, and fostering regional cooperation, Bangladesh can ensure a stable and

Bangladesh wants to put emphasis on defence and economic cooperation for the interests
of the future of the relationship between the two countries.
Besides, it is also necessary to reevaluate the various conditions of Chinese loans taking
into account the current financial crisis in the country.
Experts made such remarks in a discussion on the future of Bangladesh-China relations at
a hotel in the capital on Monday.
Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) and Centre for China
Studies (SIIS-DU) jointly organised the discussion with the help of the Chinese embassy in
Dhaka.
Addressing the opening session of the seminar as the chief guest, foreign affairs adviser
Md Touhid Hossain said that Bangladesh has witnessed the most significant political
change in its history. As a result, the future of Bangladesh-China relations in the post-
revolutionary context must be taken into consideration from a wider perspective.
Hinting that the interim government wants to continue defence
cooperation between Bangladesh and China, Touhid Hossain said,
defence is an important element of the relationship between the two
countries
He further said the course of Bangladesh and various other factors, especially in the post-
revolution situation, may impact the relationship with China.
Political stability in Bangladesh and the changing context of regional and global politics
are included among those factors.
Hinting that the interim government wants to continue defence cooperation between
Bangladesh and China, Touhid Hossain said, defence is an important element of the
relationship between the two countries.
He mentioned that China is an important supplier of arms to Bangladesh. China also
trains members of the armed forces of Bangladesh. Bangladesh wants more defence
cooperation from China to modernise the army in the future.25/05/2025, 10:10 BIISS seminar: Relation with China should be considered holistically
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/6eqo5o7e3h 2/4In his speech, the foreign adviser put emphasis on the removal of non-tariff barriers for
Bangladeshi products in the Chinese market in order to eliminate the trade imbalance
between the two countries.
It is important to reevaluate the Chinese loan conditions in the context of the current
economic pressure in Bangladesh, he pointed out.
Speaking about the trade deficit between the two countries, Touhid said, “It would be
better for us if it is possible to increase exports to China through Chinese investment in
Bangladesh. Some projects are going on with the help of China and we hope to have an
impact on the country’s economy.”
Stating that China and others are helping on the Rohingya issue, the foreign adviser said,
“Unfortunately, such initiatives have not yet brought any results. I think China has an
influence over Myanmar and that is a reality. China should play a greater role in this
matter so that the Rohingyas can return to their country with their rights and safety.”
Head of the National White Paper Drafting Committee and honorary fellow at Centre for
Policy Dialogue (CPD), Debapriya Bhattacharya, also spoke at the event.
He said trade does not depend only on market facilities. Its expansion also depends on the
process.
""That is why, we have to take into consideration the issue of non-tariff barriers for the
sake of the future of relations in getting 100 per cent benefits for the Bangladeshi products
in the Chinese market,"" Debapriya Bhattacharya.
Putting emphasis on bringing changes in the process of Chinese loans to Bangladesh, he
said that if you look at Bangladesh’s foreign loans, you will see that about US $5.6 billion
will go to China. It is about 10 per cent of Bangladesh’s total foreign debt. As a result, debt
repayment has become a growing challenge for Bangladesh.
Debapriya further said Chinese debt includes supply debt, which has a shorter repayment
period. The grace period is also less. Besides, the terms are stricter and commitmentIt would be better for us if it is possible to increase exports

He pointed out that the Karnaphuli tunnel will not be financially sustainable unless there
is proper Chinese investment in the designated specialised industrial zone for China in

More transparency should be brought for the sake of future relations between the two
countries, he argued.

Expanding the Bangladesh-China trade
frontier
Mon Oct 10, 2016 12:00 AM
Last update on: Mon Oct 10, 2016 02:30 AM
Chinese President Xi Jinping will be visiting Dhaka for an official visit on October
15, 2016. This is happening three decades after Chinese President Li Xiannian
visited Bangladesh in March 1986. This high-profile visit has already triggered
considerable optimism in all quarters due to the fact that China is the biggest
trade partner and one of the most trusted friends of Bangladesh since formal
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina with Chinese President Xi Jinping. PHOTO: AFP
diplomatic relations were established in mid-1970s. Both the countries are ready
with a number of agreements worth billions, covering trade, investment and
developmental cooperation, to sign during President Xi Jinping's visit.
Bangladesh-China bilateral trade has been increasing significantly over the years,
both in terms of absolute amount and percentage change among Bangladesh's top
trade partners. As per the statistics of Export Promotion Bureau of Bangladesh,
the country's total merchandised export to China was USD 808.14 million in the
year 2015-16, which was only USD 319.66 million in 2010-11. Thus, Bangladesh's
export to China grew at an annual average of 30 percent in the last five years.
Nevertheless, the recent export growth has been quite slow, only 6 and 2.2
percent in 2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively. The share of exports to China was
merely 2.4 percent of the total export in the immediate past fiscal year. 
On the other hand, merchandised imports from China have been the highest for
quite some time. The extrapolated data of Bangladesh Bank shows that import
from China was worth about USD 9.8 billion in 2015-16, which was USD 5.9 billion
in 2010-11. However, the growth of import was considerably lower than export
during this period, on average 13 percent per annum. Conversely, the share of
imports of China is growing quite well; from 20.7 percent in 2013-14, it has
become about 24.1 percent of the total merchandised imports from the country in
2015-16 as per Bangladesh Bank data. Together, Bangladesh's trade with China is
now about 26.5 percent of its total trade with the world, which is the highest with
a rising trend. If this rate prevails, the total bilateral trade would be USD18 billion
in 2021, when the country would celebrate its 50th anniversary.
Bangladesh mainly imports raw materials for its textiles and clothing from China,
such as cotton, yarn, fabrics, staple fibers and accessories for its readymade
garments (RMG) industry, which is nearly 35 percent of total imports. The latest
data of Bangladesh Bank reveals that the country imported cotton, cotton
yarn/thread and cotton fabrics (19.6 percent); man-made staple fibres and knitted
or crocheted fabrics (10.1 percent); man-made filaments, strip and the like of
manmade textile materials (3.8 percent); and other fabrics and apparel
accessories (2.8 percent). The other notable import items are boilers, machinery,
mechanical appliances and their parts (16.4 percent); electrical machinery and
equipment and parts (12.2 percent); and fertiliser, plastic, chemicals, and iron
and steel (13.1 percent). The country also imports some food items from China. 
On the export side, the top five items constituted about 80 percent of total exports
in 2015-16, of which 42.2 percent is woven and knit garments as per the double-
digit harmonised code. The main items are woven garments (24.5 percent),
leather products and travel items (17.9 percent), knitwear (17.8 percent), paper
yarn and woven fabric (12.6 percent), and raw leather (6.5 percent). Fish and
footwear are also getting prominence (8.5 percent) in the export basket. Thus, a
complementarity is evident in the export and import items, which is believed to
create synergy especially in Bangladesh's export-oriented RMG industry.
Bangladesh is basically sourcing raw materials and machinery for its textiles and
clothing sector.
Despite these positive developments in bilateral trade, there are certain gray
areas and constraining factors disfavouring Bangladesh in optimising mutual
gains from trade. The first and foremost is very high amount of negative trade
balance of Bangladesh, which is currently 85 percent of total bilateral trade. It is
mainly due to low export value and its very slow growth in recent years. A slightly
encouraging fact is that relative trade deficit has been on the decline — it was 90
percent of total bilateral trade in 2010-11. The declining ratio of trade deficit is
perhaps due to duty-free access of around 5,000 Bangladeshi items to the Chinese
market under the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA). Bangladesh, however,
needs zero-tariff access of 99 percent items, including RMG products. If China
grants this concession, it would significantly help reduce gigantic trade deficit,
and bilateral trade would be much larger in the foreseeable future.
Further strengthening of value chain is imperative to benefit the textiles and
clothing sector of Bangladesh. China is a cheap source of raw materials, which is
being utilised to maintain trade surplus with the European and North American
countries. Cost of importing garment inputs from China could be reduced in two
ways: reducing time of clearance in sea ports by improving capacity of Chittagong
port and extending Chinese production base of non-cotton RMG inputs by
constructing relevant factories in Bangladesh. Though the earlier option is
immediately required, the latter would help China's costly and declining
industries to locate a gainful place and strengthen the bilateral value chain.  
Finally, Chinese involvement in Bangladesh's two special economic zones (SEZs)
and establishing a dedicated export processing zone (EPZ) for China would help
boost bilateral trade and increase Bangladesh's exports to the global market. Even
though the SEZ Authority is on the fast track in offering China's desired SEZs in
Chittagong and Mongla, the sites have been far from ready in the last two years.
There will also likely be complications in constructing EPZ as can be inferred
from the experience of the Korean EPZ. Therefore, both parties should come
together to assess the ground reality and expedite the process to operationalise
the SEZ. The joint communiqué of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and President Xi
Jinping should cover these issues.

opportunities of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since it is very important for economic ties.
The suggestion came at an international conference on BRI organised by CPD at a hotel in
the capital.
CPD chairman Rehman Sobhan said BRI is very important for Bangladesh.
""China is investing in many sectors in Bangladesh. Many investors will invest here in
future as well. So, we need to negotiate more about BRI opportunities. Mapping is also
needed in the invested areas here,"" he said.
Industries minister Nurul Majid Humayun said there is a good relation between
Bangladesh and China. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina also visited the country.
""BRI is very important for south Asian countries,"" he said, adding that a developed
economic tie will be established with China through BRI.
Foreign ministry senior secretary Md Shahidul Haque said BRI is very significant for the
country's infrastructure development and trade.
""We're in key position of the belt. We've to negotiate about its opportunities,"" he said.
Former caretaker government advisor Syed Manzur Elahi presided over the function while
Fahmida Khatun, executive director of CPD, read out the keynote papers.Prothom Alo English Desk25/05/2025, 10:32 Bangladesh must negotiate more for BRI opportunities: Speakers

25/05/2025, 10:59 Bangladesh receives record FDI in 2018, China tops investors’ list
https://bdnews24.com/amp/story/economy%2Fbangladesh-receives-record-fdi-in-2018-china-tops-investors-list 2/9Briefing the media on Thursday , Executive Chairman of Bangladesh Investment Development Authority
(BIDA) Kazi M Aminul Islam said, the $3.6 billion FDI in 2018 was 68 percent more than the previous year .
“This is a record,” he said, “If the trend continues, we hope the FDI figures will touch double digits in 2021”.
Bangladesh is traditionally a low FDI-attracting country . The FDI was less than 100 million even in 1996
when the ruling Awami League first came to power .
“It became more than half a billion in its five years,” the BIDA  chairman, Islam, said.
“Then again it fell. It hit the $1 billion mark for the first time in 2008, following investment in the telecom
sector . The FDI crossed that figure again in 201 1 under the Awami Legaue government and has gradually
increased ever since.”

https://bdnews24.com/amp/story/economy%2Fbangladesh-receives-record-fdi-in-2018-china-tops-investors-list 3/9“We saw a slight decline in 2017 - $2.1 billion - compared to 2016 due to a 23 percent decline in overall
investments globally .”
The net FDI was recorded at $3.6 billion in 2018 as equity investment and reinvestment doubled from the
previous year while intra-company loans increased by four times.
Describing the significance of the development, the executive chairman said, “It means confidence, it
means they (foreign investors) are very comfortable about investing here now more than before.”
In 2018, Bangladesh was the recipient of a dif ferent type of investment in the form of mergers and
acquisitions, he added. But the figures did not account for the investment made by Japan Tobacco.
“If we add that $1.4 billion, then FDI figure will go up to $5 billion”.
BIDA  MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
The BIDA  executive chairman credits the FDI growth to economic stability , political stability , controlling
inflation along with a young and talented workforce.
“It’s very clear to foreign investors that the Bangladeshi economy is expanding from within while integrating
with the rest of the world at the same time.”
“BIDA  had a big role in this,” he said, referring to the creation of BIDA  two years ago through the merger of
the Board of Investment and Privatisation Commission.Ad25/05/2025, 10:59 Bangladesh receives record FDI in 2018, China tops investors’ list
https://bdnews24.com/amp/story/economy%2Fbangladesh-receives-record-fdi-in-2018-china-tops-investors-list 4/9Prior to the advent of BIDA, between 2009 and 2016, the average annual proposal for investments was
Tk193 billion. But since its inception,  the figure has soared to Tk 945 billion per year .
He said that the investment body is implementing the One Stop Service (OSS) Act. “W e have already
started online OSS for BIDA  and registered joint stock company services. Fifteen BIDA  services were
already of fered online through the OSS and we are starting another seven services. So we are making 22
services available under the OSS.”
“As a result, we are seeing an upward trend and in future, it will rise further ,” he said.
Chinese investment totalled $1.03 billion in 2018 with the bulk of it - $834 million - coming in the power
sector .  In 2017, China invested only $1 19 million in the country .
But US investments only saw a marginal increase, rising to $174 million from $166 million in 2017.
Islam attributes this to the US administration’ s policy of massive tax cuts for internal investments. The US’ s
investment has declined globally as a result.
On the contrary , China is investing in the region under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which Bangladesh
joined in 2016 during President Xi Jinping’ s visit.
The major overall investments in 2018 came in the power sector followed by food, agriculture and fishing,
textile and garment, banking, telecom and gas and petroleum sectors.
“We are presenting Bangladesh’ s possibilities in a focused way . We have targeted some specific countries
such as Japan, Germany , India, UK and US for future investment. W e have targeted some big companiesAd

How our youth can leverage Bangladesh-
China ties
Fri Apr 11, 2025 11:00 AM
Last update on: Fri Apr 11, 2025 12:21 PM
The relationship between Bangladesh and China is neither recent nor purely
political. It has been deeply rooted in history, friendship, and cultural exchange
for over a thousand years. The historical connection dates back to the second
century BCE, when Chinese envoy Zhang Qian of the Han dynasty emperor
documented vibrant civilisations in Magadha, now a part of Bangladesh. Over
Recent bilateral dialogues between Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus and Chinese President Xi Jinping offer practical
and significant economic benefits for Bangladesh’s youths. PHOTO: CA PRESS WING
subsequent centuries, Chinese Buddhist monks such as Xuanzang and Fa Xian
travelled to this region seeking knowledge. Conversely, Bengali scholar Monk
Atish Dipankar journeyed across the Himalayas to spread Bengal's spiritual and
cultural heritage to China. During the 14th and 15th centuries, Bengal's sultans
used to send regular diplomatic missions to China's Ming Dynasty, reciprocated
by the Admiral of the Ming Navy Zheng He's historic voyages to Bengal. The
Chinese referred to Bengal as ""Pang-ge-la""—a name that evolved into today's
""Meng-jia-la,"" the contemporary Chinese pronunciation for Bangladesh.
As Bangladesh and China celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations in 2025, this
enduring relationship stands on the firm foundation of centuries-old people-to-
people bonds. During Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus's official visit to
China, a joint press statement was released on March 28, 2025, to commemorate
this significant milestone by declaring 2025 the ""China-Bangladesh Year of
People-to-People Exchanges."" This initiative aims to deepen bilateral cooperation
across various sectors, including culture, tourism, media, education, healthcare,
youth exchanges, local government collaboration, and think tank partnerships.
At this historic juncture, Bangladesh now has a strategic opportunity to leverage
these strengthened cultural and interpersonal ties to unlock sustainable
economic and social benefits—particularly addressing critical issues such as
employment opportunities for youths through modern skill development.

The dragon and the delta
Recently, research findings shared at a seminar titled ""National Image of China in
Bangladesh"" showed overwhelmingly positive sentiment among Bangladeshis
towards China in nurturing friendly relationships, sharing technological
development, opportunities for higher education, medical tourism, and creating
a strong trading partnership with China.
China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner, facilitating $16.63 billion in imports
and just $715.37 million in exports to and from Bangladesh, respectively, in 2024.
On the other hand, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from China to Bangladesh
was $2.67 billion as of September 2024. Nearly 1,000 Chinese enterprises and
multinational corporations operate in Bangladesh, creating tremendous
employment opportunities.
In this context, youths in Bangladesh could further enhance their employment
opportunities in Chinese enterprises and multinational corporations by acquiring
practical knowledge of the Chinese language and culture, China-related studies,
and technical education in various areas. The existing cooperation with China
also opens up entrepreneurship opportunities for many youths—a path actively
encouraged by Professor Muhammad Yunus, who consistently urges the youths to
become job creators rather than job seekers. Such entrepreneurial efforts,
enabled by fluency in Chinese and a deeper understanding of Chinese culture,
could open new avenues of hope, economic empowerment, sustained career
growth, and global opportunities for Bangladeshi youths.
Fluency in Chinese is more vital than ever. For people-to-people friendship and
mutual prosperity, communication barriers must be overcome. Systematic
Chinese language education, available through universities, Confucius Institutes,
and specialised China Studies programmes, is a transformative tool. Nearly 20,000
Bangladeshi students are studying in China, and around 3,000 students are
trained annually through two Confucius Institutes at North-South and Dhaka
University, as well as one Confucius Classroom in Bangladesh. These can open
significant career paths for youth, including employment opportunities in
Chinese companies in Bangladesh, entrepreneurship linked to China's global
market and Belt and Road Initiative, higher education and research opportunities
in China, and participation in governmental and development projects under the
Global Development Initiative framework.

How Bangladesh can navigate the geopolitical crossroads
Medical tourism is another significant emerging sector, notably strengthened by
China's recent decision to designate hospitals in Kunming specifically for
Bangladeshi medical tourists. Youths fluent in Chinese can capitalise on
opportunities as medical interpreters, healthcare logistics coordinators, and
medical tourism entrepreneurs.
Given this scenario, Bangladesh could benefit substantially from Chinese
President Xi Jinping's vision of ""mass entrepreneurship and innovation,""
emphasising the empowerment of ordinary citizens, particularly youth, to
innovate, start businesses, and drive economic growth. The broader vision
outlined through President Xi's Global Development Initiative highlights inclusive
growth, poverty alleviation, and innovation. It perfectly aligns with Bangladesh's
immediate needs. China's model of ""Common Prosperity"" and sustainable
development, known as ""Ecological Civilisation,"" echoes the vision of
Bangladesh's Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus's concept of a ""World of
Three Zeros""—Zero Poverty, Zero Unemployment, and Zero Net Carbon Emissions.
Leveraging ideas from both President Xi and Professor Yunus could become
instrumental in addressing Bangladesh's youth unemployment crisis through
innovation, entrepreneurship, and green jobs, ensuring ""high-quality
development.""
Recent comments from Chen Huaiyu, chairman of the China Export-Import Bank
(China Exim Bank), during the sidelines of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual
Conference 2025, suggest even brighter prospects. Chen said that China Exim
Bank is eager to support relocating Chinese manufacturing plants to Bangladesh,
positioning Bangladesh as an export platform serving Southeast Asia, the Middle
East, and beyond. Emulating the transformative experience of Vietnam,
Bangladesh could substantially boost employment by attracting Chinese and
other international manufacturers. This would necessitate improvements in
Bangladesh's business environment—a goal already endorsed by Professor Yunus.
The commitments made by China during the recent bilateral dialogues—
including plans for high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, modernisation of
Mongla Port, joint development of the China Economic and Industrial Zone in
Chattogram, and expedited negotiation of a Free Trade Agreement—offer
practical and significant economic benefits for Bangladesh's youths.
Furthermore, Bangladesh's active participation in global expos, such as the China
International Import Expo and China-South Asia Expo, provides young
entrepreneurs direct access to international markets. The joint press release also
shows that China will import more goods than ever from Bangladesh. Partnership
with China's steady and pragmatic development approach—built on non-
interference, mutual respect, and a ""win-win"" cooperative approach—represents
stability, growth, and hope. Embracing President Xi Jinping's vision of building a
""Community of Shared Future for Mankind"" gives Bangladeshi youths a unique
opportunity to participate actively in global development and diplomatic efforts.
Just as historical figures like Zhang Qian, Fa Xian, Atish Dipankar, and Admiral
Zheng He once illuminated paths between two great civilisations, today's youth
stand at the threshold of a similarly profound opportunity—to become modern-
day torchbearers of this timeless friendship. As 2025 marks the golden jubilee of
diplomatic ties and celebrates the ""Year of People-to-People Exchanges,"" it is not
just a ceremonial milestone. It shows a beacon of immense promise. To truly
grasp the rich possibilities, our youth and educational institutes must recognise
that language and culture are not just fields of study. They are bridges of
empowerment, keys to global understanding, and doors to lifelong prosperity.
Thus, investing strategically in Chinese language and cultural education may
become Bangladesh's most powerful tool, enabling its youth to craft a shared
future of lasting harmony, boundless opportunity, and mutual development with
China.

BRI to help Bangladesh's real GDP growth by 2.1pc: report
FE DESK REPORT

Sep 22, 2023 14:59Updated :
Sep 22, 2023 15:01
 For all latest news, follow The Financial Express Google News channel.
A recent report estimated that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will help Bangladesh's real
gross domestic product (GDP) growth by at least 2.1 per cent, generate an additional 2.5 per
cent to 5.1 per cent of employment, and decrease extreme poverty by 1.3 per cent.
The report, titled ʻThe Belt and Road in Bangladesh Achievements and Way Forward,ʼ was
published in Dhaka on Thursday by the Chinese embassy in Bangladesh.
The report said that the BRI activities in Bangladesh primarily encompass three areas:
infrastructure development, energy and power collaboration, and social and cultural
exchange.
Taking the examples of the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, the Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman Tunnel, and the Expansion and Strengthening of Power System Network,
the report said estimations based on different modeling approaches indicate substantial
positive effects on GDP, trade, employment generation and poverty reduction, reports
Xinhua.
According to the report, depending on the specific scenarios considered, the BRI projects
are projected to create an additional 1.8 million to 3.6 million employment opportunities.
Meanwhile, the report said that the BRI offers an additional opportunity for Chinese
investment and financing in infrastructure and connectivity projects, which can stimulate
Bangladesh's supply response and external competitiveness.
It demonstrated BRI's ""transformative power in driving economic growth and uplifting
communities from poverty,"" said the report.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/bri-to-help-bangladeshs-real-gdp-growth-by-21pc-report 1/4Also, the report called on both countries to collaborate to improve the ease of doing
business, identify and eliminate investment barriers, and establish a favorable legal
framework to protect the rights and interests of investors and consumers.
1. A. Mannan, Bangladeshi Planning Minister, stated in the report's message that
Bangladesh, as a member of the BRI global cooperation alliance of China, has already
started benefiting from the BRI, including China's financial investment and contractual
construction obligations.
""The investment made by BRI will continue to contribute to development initiatives of
Bangladesh competitive in the future and will help to achieve vision 2041,"" said Mannan.
""As we have seen for the past few years, the BRI has changed the landscape of Bangladesh,""
stated the message by Bangladesh's commerce minister Tipu Munshi, adding that the
investment in the power sector enabled Bangladesh to realize 100 percent electrification.
The investment in the digital sector has also brought the dream of Digital and Smart
Bangladesh one step closer, and the investment in roads and railways has transformed the
trade landscape in Bangladesh and ensured faster connectivity throughout the country and
the South Asian region as well, said the commerce minister.
Yao Wen, Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh, stated in the report's message, ""I am
convinced that under the framework of BRI, more and more Chinese enterprises and
people will devote themselves to the goal of Smart Bangladesh, proposing Chinese
solutions and making even more contributions to the realisation of 'Vision 2041'.""

China of course stands as a towering figure, with its economic prowess, technological
advancements, and strategic vision. With Bangladesh aspiring to transcend its developmental
challenges and carve out a prosperous future, having a friend in China will be extremely
important. 
China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has already laid the groundwork for enhanced connectivity
between the two nations. The China-Bangladesh Economic Corridor can be a game-changer by
bolstering infrastructure development. Robust transportation networks, upgraded ports, and
efficient logistics will not only facilitate seamless trade but also stimulate economic growth
across diverse sectors.
The transfer of technology and knowledge from China to Bangladesh can also serve as a catalyst
for industrialization and innovation. China is already helping with many of Bangladesh’s
megaprojects, and more collaborative ventures will only enhance productivity.
China and Bangladesh both also have aspirations for a greener future. Joint efforts in renewable
energy projects and eco-friendly initiatives can address shared challenges of climate change and
environmental degradation. China's experience in managing urbanization can also provide
valuable insights as Bangladesh grapples with the complexities of rapid urban development.
Bangladesh wants to become a developed nation in less than two decades, and it can accelerate its
journey towards economic prosperity and societal well-being by continuing to strengthen its ties
with a nation such as China. The time is ripe for both nations to take this partnership to the next
level.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/352144/china-s-financial-assistance 1/4Wednesday afternoon at the Great Hall of the People. Xi Jinping made his last discussion at a
recent meeting on the sideline of the 15th BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
The Bangladesh Prime Minister also met with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang at the Great Hall
of the People on Wednesday morning. Li Qiang has announced $1 billion in financial assistance
for Bangladesh, adding new dimensions to Bangladesh's development. 
After the meeting, Bangladesh and China signed several Memorandum of Understandings(MoU).
Cooperation in the economic and banking sectors, trade and investment, digital economy,
infrastructure development, assistance in disaster management, construction of the 6th and 8th
Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge, agro-export from Bangladesh, and communication among
the people have been signed. 
In the meeting with Xi Jinping and Li Qiang, all topics regarding bilateral relations were
discussed. Issues relating to the Rohingya, business and commerce between the nations, and
development cooperation were all raised and discussed at length.
The financial support pledged by PM Li Qiang is a massive opportunity for Bangladesh. Proper
and effective use of the funds will add a new dimension to the country's development. However,
if not used correctly, it can also cause serious harm. Some mega projects in Bangladesh are not
profitable and do not significantly contribute to the country's economy. Therefore, they must
consider the country's economy's profitability, implementation, and significance when picking
new projects.

Some mega projects in Bangladesh are not profitable and do not
significantly contribute to the country's economy
Considering the country's history of corruption, experts have warned that corruption will likely
increase if such a massive amount of money is not used correctly. Proper and transparent use of
this money must be ensured. For this, effective monitoring and accountability systems should be
introduced so that no money is wasted or corrupted.
During this visit, 21 MoUs and agreements between the two countries were signed to strengthen
cooperation. Under the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) project, infrastructure development will be
conducted in Bangladesh. Various more agreements were signed to increase trade and investment.
The Education and Cultural Exchange agreement was signed to improve both aspects. China also
promised that it will help Bangladesh gain BRICS membership. 
In addition, China will back Bangladesh to resolve the Rohingya crisis, and China's role in
solving this crisis may be necessary. The Rohingya refugee problem is a severe humanitarian and
economic challenge for Bangladesh. If China plays an active role in solving this crisis, it will be a
significant boost for Bangladesh. 
PM Hasina's visit to China has unveiled a new horizon for Bangladesh. If appropriately used,
China's $1bn financial support will take the country's economy to new heights. Picking need-
oriented mega projects, ensuring zero corruption and full transparency, and developing China-
Bangladesh relations are essential for the country's overall development. China's cooperation with
Bangladesh has unveiled a new horizon and will positively impact the country's economy.
However, the country's development must progress through this opportunity's proper and
effective use.

ANM Muniruzzaman on Thursday said Bangladesh needs to remain very careful about keeping
its national interest protected as strategic landscape in the Asia Pacific region is rapidly changing.
""Strategic landscape is changing rapidly. We need to observe it very carefully,"" he said while
addressing a virtual dialogue titled “Bangladesh-China Development Cooperation: Experience
and Outlook”.
""Don't become part of military agreements or soft military agreements. We should be very careful
in maintaining our status,"" he said mentioning recent agreement between India and the United
States.
He put emphasis on maintaining strategic autonomy which is fundamental to maintaining
economic autonomy or economic freedom with competitiveness.
""We, as a first tract developing country, need to have strategic autonomy so that we have
economic freedom to cooperate with everybody,"" Muniruzzaman said.
He said Bangladesh is a signatory of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and at the same time
Bangladesh believes in the principles of Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS).
""We want to remain active part of the BRI and at the same time we want to cooperate with the
IPS,"" Muniruzzaman said emphasizing taking maximum advantage of both the initiatives for
national interest.

ʻBangladesh can’t wait forever to resolve
the Teesta issue’
Mon Sep 5, 2022 07:41 PM
Last update on: Tue Sep 6, 2022 04:17 PM
Dr Im tiaz Ahmed, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, talks
about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ongoing visit to India and what to expect in
the future of Bangladesh-India relations in an interview with Shuprova
Tasneem of The Daily Star.
Will importing fuel from Russia be a major talking point during the prime
minister's trip, and can that affect our relationship with other nations?িতা  িনেয়  খালাখুিল  আেলাচনা  হওয়া  উিচত িতা  িনেয়  খালাখুিল  আেলাচনা  হওয়া  উিচত
In light of the Covid pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, there will definitely
be a focus on energy security. India still has a relationship with Russia and has
not looked into sanctions the way the West wanted. Bangladesh would definitely
want to learn how we can benefit from this relationship.
At the same time, one should know that any energy insecurity in Bangladesh
would also become a problem for the West. Our main export markets for ready-
made garment (RMG) products are in the US and Europe. If we suffer from energy
insecurity and it costs us more to produce RMG products, it will also increase
their costs and reduce their profit margins. So I believe it will be a win-win
situation for all if we can resolve our energy problems, either through a good
relationship with Russia by purchasing directly, or through help from India,
particularly when it comes to payment and other mechanisms.
How important is Bangladesh in India's Look East Policy, especially given
India's current relationship with China?
The importance depends on how much honey there is in the pot. If there is more
instability and less economic development, this interest will fizzle out. Ultimately,
geopolitics does not create human beings – it's human beings who create
geopolitics. Bangladesh's growth momentum over the last 15-20 years, despite the
obstacles faced, is what makes other countries interested in us, including India.
Bangladesh has by now managed to convince the world that what we are
interested in is economic development. It comes from our long-cherished goal of
becoming a peaceful country – a goal that was set by the father of the nation. So
whether we have ties with India, China, Japan, the US or Russia – all of it is based
on an economic relationship, not security or military development. At the same
time, Bangladesh guarantees that we would not allow anyone to use our territory
against anyone else. That's what leads to favourable ties with Dhaka regardless of
who is in power in India, because the current regime has made good on this
promise, especially in terms of dealing with insurgency coming from the
northeast. So I don't think Delhi or Beijing have any worries over Bangladesh's ties
with others, since a military alliance is never on the cards.

PM Hasina’s India visit: Will our expectations be met?
There are some concerns that Bangladesh is too dependent on trade with India
when it comes to essential goods. What is your view on this?
No country would want to be dependent on one source. We've had hiccups in this
regard, especially in terms of onion import, which forced us to look to Egypt and
Pakistan. We have already opened a channel with Russia for wheat, so I don't
think this is really an issue. The problem is that whenever we discuss trade or
connectivity, we fall back on traditional linkages and use a piecemeal approach.
Political will is required to look at the bigger picture. To this date, we have not
been able to mainstream technology and talk about creating new structures. For
example, we are currently discussing updating railway structures from the British
era. But with the existing technology, it's not difficult to think of a high-speed
train between Dhaka and Delhi. There are countries that have changed their
entire geographical composition like this, such as China. So why are we not
thinking about this?
The first thing that needs to change is our mindset. We are very conservative
when it comes to planning and investing in long-term projects. The fact that India
spends huge resources on the conflict with Pakistan could be part of this. There
are an estimated half a million troops in Kashmir alone, it's unthinkable. But
beyond the funding, there is also a lack of imagination. Technology has given us
the opportunity to not be slaves to geography, and we should take advantage of
that. The possibilities in this region are immense.
While there are talks of other water-sharing treaties, we are still no closer to a
resolution on the Teesta.
I can't speak for the policymakers, but it's possible they think that if we go
forward with other water-sharing agreements, we can tone down the issue of
Teesta and return to it later. But if we fail to resolve the Teesta issue and go ahead
with other agreements, then there will of course be criticism, and the
government will have to deal with that. One estimate suggests that the livelihoods
of 20 million people are impacted by the Teesta River. If we keep their concerns
hanging for so long, despite there even being a draft agreement, and move on to
other rivers that don't impact as many people, it will definitely become a political
and a partisan issue.
So why is the Teesta issue not being resolved? We need to have frank discussions
with Delhi on the factor that is Sikkim. There are 30-32 small and big dams for
hydroelectric power that are estimated to be affecting around five percent of
water flow in each of the dams, according to one eminent Indian hydrologist,
leading to a lean seasonal flow draining into Bangladesh. Mamata Banerjee's
contention around Teesta is all about this – not considering Sikkim in the
calculations.
Will they deconstruct the dams? Of course not. But Bangladesh can try to solve
this by storing rain/floodwater from the rainy season and letting it flow during
winter. There are environmental and monetary costs: one calculation suggests it
will be around USD 1 billion. Although China showed some interest, India
immediately became fearful of it. One way to resolve this is by creating a
consortium where different stakeholders can provide the funding and expertise
for this infrastructure. India must accept that Bangladesh will not wait forever to
resolve this issue.

Understanding the proposed Bangladesh-India
Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)
Will Myanmar an d the Rohingya refugees be a part of the discussions in Delhi?
Definitely. The point that some of us are also raising is, now that there are talks
about a tripartite engagement on the Rohingyas between China, Myanmar and
Bangladesh, why can't Delhi organise the same? That is something I think our
prime minister would flag this time, especially since we have not seen much
progress on this issue. Given that India has good relationships with both
Bangladesh and Myanmar, it can play a critical role. Take, for example, Turkey's
involvement in talks between Russia and Ukraine to open a Black Sea corridor for
the export of grains, which helped it become one of the big players when it comes
to negotiations in this conflict. Playing a similar role in the Rohingya issue could
also boost India's global status. This is especially pertinent now after the two ICJ
judgments recognising the ""Rohingya"" identity and the US calling the Myanmar
military actions against the Rohingyas a ""genocide.""
Why have we stopped talking about border killings?
This is very unfortunate. If a smuggler is not armed, you can arrest him, but
killing him is not permitted under the Indian Constitution or the international
law. And then there are the killings of civilians like 15-year-old Felani Khatun.
Yet, during the Galwan dispute on the India-China border, not a single shot was
fired. Why is that? Because of a 1996 agreement between China and India that
stipulates no-one can carry firearms for two kilometres on each side of the
border. So if this can be done there, why can't it be done on our borders?

The Chinese government's vision is to double 2010 national income by 2020 with the nation
pushing towards transforming its economy from a largely export-driven one to services and
domestic consumption, from labour and energy-intensive manufacturing towards
innovative, hi-tech and higher value-added production, and from quantity to quality and
ecological sustainability.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/rich-dividends-expected-of-chinese-belt-road-initiative-1510152534 1/9China has joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO) more than a decade ago. Its
government used the ascension negotiations to reform its domestic economy. The
improved efficiency plus better market access from joining the organisation propelled a
decade of rapid development and made China what it is today. But the Chinese economy is
overburdened with the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The reform of SOEs means
integrating weak and strong companies, breaking large, unmanageable companies into
smaller entities, and closing those that are heavily indebted and unable to continue
without outside support.
Party leaders and bureaucrats are beneficiaries of SOEs in China like Soviet Union. ""Many
senior Communist Party officials are running state enterprises, or local government officials
with local state enterprises, and they like to continue with these sources of income and
employment. So, it is not easy to carry out the reform. The biggest obstacle to SOE reform,
however, is politics"", said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
China has surplus industrial output which can be beneficially utilised along the belt and
road (B&R) projects. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) forecasts 580m tonnes of cement
is needed yearly for infrastructure projects in Asia alone, which is a quarter of China's
output. Construction of railways, pipelines and other projects along the B&R trade route
may create demand for 272mn tonnes of steel. This initiative will make the state-owned
industries viable.
In addition to funding, the Chinese government has sought foreign partnerships to access
expertise, new technologies and equipment, as well as management and operational
experience in managing large-scale, complex infrastructure projects. Chinese construction
enterprises can benefit from partnerships with foreign companies on gaining experience in
large scale infrastructure projects involving multiple countries and stakeholders, which
might be new to them.
The traditional economic structure of China, which relied on investing massively in fixed
assets and exporting low-skilled labour-intensive products, is running out of steam. It now
requires a new model to support economic development, through building many high-
tech, high value-added sectors, which is not easy to achieve in a short time. This is the
typical ""middle-income trap"" challenge.
About three decades ago, the economies of South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong faced the
same ""middle-income trap"" challenges as domestic labour costs rose sharply. These
countries relocated most of their labour-intensive manufacturing factories to the eastern
coastal regions of China and went on to upgrade domestic industrial structure. This process
not only helped South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong to overcome the ""middle-income
trap"" but also helped mainland China to achieve industrialisation and modernisation25/05/2025, 12:26 Rich dividends expected of Chinese Belt & Road initiative | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/rich-dividends-expected-of-chinese-belt-road-initiative-1510152534 2/9simultaneously and created many jobs. The B&R has similar plan to relocate labour-
intensive low technology industries to other countries. This will not only help China to
overcome the ""middle-income trap"" by transforming its economic structure but will also
create unprecedented opportunities for all the developing countries along the B&R to
achieve economic take-off.
The initiative focuses mostly on infrastructure and is expected to open opportunities across
industries. Professional service firms are preparing to meet investor demands, and are
anticipating potential risks related to infrastructure projects associated with such a large-
scale, cross-border initiative. Risk management and due diligence practices will be at the
forefront of any business dealings coming from the ambitious strategy.
While B&R has the potential to harness the synergy of economic globalisation and China's
domestic reforms, it cannot be pushed through by political fiat in Beijing. The initiative is
expected to have a major impact on China's domestic front and internationally. One of the
key domestic objectives is to accelerate the development of China's west and central
provinces. The plan divides the nation into five regions with infrastructure plans to connect
with neighbouring countries and increase connectivity.
The 2015 State Council's action plan identifies 18 provinces under the B&R initiative. All
provinces immediately were compelled to include B&R in their government reports, even
though some regions were tangential to the original plan. Local governments have since
raced to secure funding from the centre and rushed to invest in purportedly B&R projects,
contributing to the economic bubble. China's reform needs global impetus, but a political
campaign is hardly the solution.
China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is not only the most ambitious and all-encompassing
economic development project in the history of humanity but also the core of what is likely
to be China's grand strategy for the 21st century. It aims to connect China and Europe in a
web of roads, high-speed rail, power lines, ports, pipelines, fibre-optic lines and other
infrastructure with the goal of stimulating growth in scores of developing countries in
between. The goal of B&R is to connect China, Europe and Africa also under a vast network
of oil and gas pipelines, data centres, power plants and transnational high voltage power
lines, airports, water canals, deep water ports, energy terminals, logistical hubs and free
trade zones.  New maritime trade corridors provide China with new shipping alternatives
while offering its less developed western, northern and south-western provinces easier
access to new markets.
Domestically, the BRI will serve a major goal, i.e. giving greater impetus to the longstanding
'go west' policies aimed at rebalancing economic development between the industrialised
coastal provinces and the inner provinces. Most of the growth potential for domestic25/05/2025, 12:26 Rich dividends expected of Chinese Belt & Road initiative | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/rich-dividends-expected-of-chinese-belt-road-initiative-1510152534 3/9demand is in the relatively underdeveloped inland provinces, where the central
government aims to foster industrialisation by shifting manufacturing away from the coast
towards a new geography of trade.  The BRI would link inland cities to global markets
through a modern network of overland routes and energy pipelines, serving as alternatives
to existing sea-lanes that cross the South China Sea and the Straits of Malacca. Geographic
rebalancing will help resolve related macroeconomic imbalances between consumption
and saving, because most of the consumption growth potential lies in the inner provinces.
Fulfilling these objectives will benefit China in many ways. On the surface, the B&R initiative
will provide markets to digest China's industrial overcapacity and facilitate trade between
the participating countries, while also potentially strengthening its diplomatic relations
globally. But there are also many other associated benefits. Trade between China and B&R
countries have exceeded US$916b in 2016, which is 25.9 per cent of China's total foreign
trade volume. Chinese companies have since established over 70 overseas economic and
trade cooperation zones.
Beyond its primary goals, the B&R initiative also complements China's national economic
reform strategy, reinforcing its 'Go Out' policy launched in the 1990s, which encouraged its
enterprises to invest overseas. The B&R initiative provides China with the opportunity to
amass vital global credentials and establish its industrial prowess, by designing and
building projects such as high-speed railways and nuclear power plants. In construction
and infrastructure, for example, Chinese SOEs have begun to achieve this by reforming their
internal procedures to enable them to assume the main contractor roles in such projects,
targeting complex projects, in difficult environments, and against strong competitors.
These reforms have also been complemented by the procurement of know-how and
capabilities through progressive acquisitions and partnerships with foreign MNCs. These
new and enhanced capabilities and skills will lead to global recognition across various
infrastructure sectors. Shining examples to date include the Hungarian-Serbian Railway, a
hydropower extension project, construction of a national motorway in Pakistan, and the
Carmel Tunnel project in Israel.
The B&R also complements with China's 13th Five-Year Plan released last year, which
further facilitates the implementation of the ""Made In China 2025"" strategy, announced in
2015 to focus on upgrading China's industries. The overarching aim is to evolve China's
traditional manufacturing sectors to higher value and higher quality manufacturing with
innovation and the latest technologies, while transitioning to a consumption-driven
economy.
In promoting China's economic expansion abroad, Beijing also must take care to address
challenges concerning the political environment, market volatility, and strategic complexity
in the one belt one region (OBOR). Ultimately, OBOR's ambitious agenda in establishing25/05/2025, 12:26 Rich dividends expected of Chinese Belt & Road initiative | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/rich-dividends-expected-of-chinese-belt-road-initiative-1510152534 4/9China as a truly globalised power requires a major role of the private sector and
engagement of an active Chinese civil society. China's reform needs OBOR. But ironically
OBOR's success calls for structural reforms.
Finally, the B&R initiative is also expected to drive greater capital flows overseas from
China, resulting in a further internationalisation of the RMB, expanding its circulation
globally and diversifying currency risks. This could open its financial institutions and
accelerate financial reforms.
Apart from strengthening China's economy, industrial capabilities and geopolitical
standing, the B&R initiative is also a catalyst for infrastructure development in some of the
least developed countries, while simultaneously driving economic growth by stimulating
trade and creating domestic jobs.

China for Bangladesh polls as per
constitution
Fri Nov 10, 2023 12:00 AM
Last update on: Fri Nov 10, 2023 08:06 AM
China wants Bangladesh's elections to be held as per the constitution, and the
relevant parties resolve their differences and maintain political and social
stability, said Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen.
He said elections are internal affairs of Bangladesh and China will not interfere in
the matter. It will continue its cooperation with Bangladesh.

Wen was addressing an event titled ""BRI@10: Ushering in Next Golden Decade"" at
a city hotel jointly organised by the Diplomatic Correspondents Association,
Bangladesh, (DCAB) and the Chinese embassy yesterday.
""Elections in all countries are internal and our policy is very clear. We hope the
elections will be conducted as per the constitution, and after the elections, there
will be stability, life will return to normal and our cooperation will continue,"" he
said.
""China sincerely hopes that all stakeholders in Bangladesh would take the
fundamental interests of the people into full consideration, properly resolve their
differences, and jointly maintain political and social stability.""
Asked about dialogue between political parties for resolving the current crisis,
the Chinese envoy said it was not for a foreign ambassador to comment on that,
rather the answer lies with the relevant parties.
""We hope the Chinese people and property will be protected. So far, we feel safe,""
Wen said in reply to a question if the Chinese businesses and people feel safe here
amid the blockade.
""The future of Bangladesh shall be determined by the people of Bangladesh.
China is full of confidence about the better future of Bangladesh as well as China-
Bangladesh relations,"" he said.
Asked how China can help Bangladesh that faces a shortage of foreign currency
reserves, Wen said if Bangladesh wants, China will support Bangladesh towards
this end.
The ambassador said it was not a problem faced only by Bangladesh, but the
whole world. However, compared to other Asian neighbours, Bangladesh still
stands out in terms of financial stability.
""So definitely that is our expectation that next year the situation will turn better,""
he said.
Responding to a query about how Bangladesh can reduce the trade gap with
China, the envoy said they are discussing the possibility of a free-trade agreement
between the two countries. The China-Bangladesh bilateral trade is close to $28
billion, but Bangladesh exports products to China worth less than $1 billion a
year.
He laid emphasis on boosting Bangladesh's exports through product
diversification.
On the Palestine issue, Wen said the UN should play its due role in resolving the
question of Palestine. The UN Security Council needs to shoulder responsibilities
for this, build international consensus as quickly as possible, and take real
measures to that end.
""Israel has the right to statehood, so does Palestine. The answer to the question is
the two-state solution and an independent state of Palestine.""

Tribune Desk
Update : 29 No v 2018, 12:41 PM
China is moving to implement a mega project titled the “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI) at a cost
of around $1 trillion. 
Publish : 29 No v 2018, 12:41 PM
 x25/05/2025, 14:50 What is Bangladesh’s take on China’s BRI?
https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/162080/what-is-bangladesh’s-take-on-china’s-bri 1/3Dubbed as the Silk Road of the 21st century, the ambitious project involves the construction of
roads and shipping lanes though countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. 
South Asian countries need to play a great role in the implementation of the project, but India,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal have yet to decide on their contributions. 
Analysts think Bangladesh will try to maintain a balance in the implementation of BRI. 
In the third week of November, the “Nepal-China Friendship Forum” organized an international
seminar in Kathmandu in which participants discussed South Asia’s gains and losses from BRI. 
Bangladesh representatives who attended the seminar hinted at Dhaka’s take on the initiative. 
India is opposing the project, as one of its crucial routes will go through Pakistan-governed
Kashmir that India claims as its own land. It is not possible for India to accept BRI in terms of
this sovereignty issue. 
However, India has no issue regarding the implementation of the proposed Bangladesh-China-
India-Myanmar (BCIM) corridor at its eastern border.
“Bangladesh prefers to maintain strategic balance with India and China. The government has long
been maintaining a balance with these two giant powers. I believe it will do the same in BRI as
well,” said Dhaka University’s economic department Prof Selim Raihan, who attended the
seminar. 
The countries to be engaged with BRI are also concerned over financial issues. 
“Initially other countries thought China would offer them a free lunch, which means Beijing
would provide all expenses and [the other countries] would get solid infrastructure and a
commercial corridor. But now they have realized that China is not doing it for free; it will give
them loans on easy terms,” said Prof Prabir Dey of Delhi-based think tank Research and
Information System for Developing Countries. 
Prof Dey, who has been working on connectivity between South Asia and China and ASEAN
countries, was one of the panelists in the seminar.

Kazi Anis Ahmed, PublisherDuring his Bangladesh visit in 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping wrote a cheque for $30 billion.
However, it became gradually clear that it was not a grant, but rather a loan. 
Prof Raihan said: “Bangladeshis have sensitivity for India, not for China. But the Sheikh Hasina-
led government has not been more inclined to either of the powers.”
For example, he said in the construction of Payra port both Indian and Chinese companies are
working together under an umbrella project, which one cannot think of elsewhere. 
The Dhaka University professor also cited some more examples. 
“Bangladesh purchased submarines for the navy from China and signed defence deals with India.
China was not given allocation for the deep sea port, but a Chinese consortium was awarded 25%
share of the Dhaka Stock Exchange. 
“So I believe Bangladesh will find a midway path regarding BRI,” Prof Raihansaid. 
Asian Tiger Capital’s Group Chairman Ifty Islam also echoed Prof Raihan. 
“China is going to emerge as the world’s greatest economy by 2050. India might also secure a top
position. So, Bangladesh cannot avoid any of its neighbours,” he said.

TIANHE: China's largest self-developed tunneling machine will be exported to Bangladesh
to assist with a river tunneling project, breaking the export monopoly of ultra-large
tunneling equipment once held by developed countries, according to Mereeg media.BN
25/05/2025, 11:44 China to export largest tunneling machine to Bangladesh | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/china-to-export-largest-tunneling-machine-to-bangladesh-1521830149 1/6The machine, with a diameter of 12.12 meters and length of 94 meters, weighs 2,200 tons. It
will be used for opening a 3,500-meter road tunnel under Karnaphuli River, China's largest
project of its kind overseas.
The project is important in the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and a key
component of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar economic corridor. It is believed to
play a significant role in improving the Asian highway network and boosting connectivity
between Bangladesh and its neighboring countries.
The export of the machine produced by Tianhe Mechanical Equipment Manufacturing Co.,
Ltd based in east China's Jiangsu province will break the monopoly of ultra-large tunneling
equipment by developed countries in the exports.
The exports of ultra-large shield tunneling machines were previously dominated by
Germany, Japan and some other developed countries. China's progress means its capacity
in design, research and development of the machines has taken the lead.
 ""The tunnel construction has been a dream for Bangladesh people,"" said Kabir Ahmed,
chief engineer of the Bangladesh Bridge Authority, adding that the project adopts Chinese
standards in design.
Delivery of the machine in such a short time fully demonstrates the ""China speed"", the
engineer pointed out.
Currently, Tianhe is developing a tunneling machine with a diameter of 13.19 meters that
will be used on Southeast Asia's first high-speed railroad linking Indonesian capital Jakarta
to Bandung. By then, the machine will be the largest one working on the construction of
Asian railways.
As for the next step, China plans to challenge the world record of tunneling machines by
building one with a diameter of 18 meters, the equivalent of a six-storey building.
Through 10 years of effort, China has shifted from following others to keeping pace and
strive to lead the development of the tunnelling machines, said Yang Huayong, an
academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Yang said that China's self-developed tunneling machines now occupy over 80 per cent of
China's newly-added market share.

Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Pakistan are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the
China-led US$1.5 trillion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), according to a Nomura Group
report.
The report also highlights potential risks to both China and countries that reap the benefits
of the project, according to a report by www.asiaasset.com.
The BRI is a development strategy by the Chinese government involving multiple mega-
infrastructure projects to improve connectivity between China and neighbouring regions
such as South Asia, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe.
Tokyo-based Nomura says Pakistan will be the biggest beneficiary in South Asia, thanks to
China's $62 billion commitment to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor.
This comprises multiple infrastructure projects, mainly to modernise Pakistan's
transportation network and energy infrastructure.
The Chinese investment is equivalent to 20 per cent of Pakistan's 2017 gross domestic
product (GDP).
Nomura's April 17 report noted that Bangladesh was set to receive total investment of $38
billion, equivalent to 15 per cent of its 2017 GDP, under the Bangladesh-China-India-
Myanmar Corridor.BN
25/05/2025, 11:16 Bangladesh, Malaysia, Pakistan to gain most from Belt and Road Initiative project | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/bangladesh-malaysia-pakistan-to-gain-most-from-belt-and-road-initiative-project-1524116263 1/5The project is aimed at improving land, rail, water and air interconnection among the four
countries.
In Southeast Asia, Nomura says Malaysia is ""well ahead of the pack in securing Chinese
investments"", with $34.2 billion, or 10 per cent of the country's 2017 GDP, in various BRI-
related infrastructure projects.
""However, China and countries receiving investments from China are exposed to multiple
risks,"" according to the report.
For China, the risk is that some BRI projects may have low returns, which will put pressure
on the country's financial sectors.
""For the recipients, an increased debt burden, sovereignty issues, execution delays and
balance-of-payment risks could come to the fore,"" the report says.
Nevertheless, Nomura believes risks for China and the beneficiary countries ""should be
manageable"".
Overall, it expects stocks related to infrastructure, financing and consumption to benefit
the most from China's BRI investments.
The project is expected to create demand for capital goods and infrastructure, such as in
the construction, industrial, telecommunication, transport and utilities sectors.
""Increased financing needs of BRI projects will benefit financials including lenders,
exchanges and brokers,"" the report says.
It also expects the BRI-related infrastructure boom to be positive for contractors
throughout Southeast Asia as well as South Korea. Companies that are expected to benefit
include Korean heavy equipment manufacturers such as Hyundai Construction Equipment
and Doosan Infracore.
The healthcare and tourism industries, mainly in Southeast Asia, are also expected to
benefit from improved inter-connectivity.

Last update on: Mon Mar 24, 2025 02:04 PM
Rohingya repatriation also on agenda
Bangladesh is expecting to boost exports and bring investment and
development support from China during Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus'
first bilateral visit that will be watched closely by regional powers in the light of
Photo: BSS
the changed Indo-Bangla ties.
Yunus' visit to China this year, which marks the 50th anniversary of China-
Bangladesh diplomatic relations, was due and has symbolic significance, said
Imtiaz Ahmed, executive director for Centre for Alternatives.
""There is no doubt that many would be watching Yunus' China visit from a
geopolitical perspective, but we should look at it through the lens of our national
interest,"" he said.
Indeed, Dhaka is more interested in enhancing economic cooperation and
discussing regional challenges, including Rohingyas, The Daily Star has learnt
from foreign ministry officials informed with the proceedings.
Dhaka and Beijing have been working on signing at least eight memoranda of
understanding, including on trade, culture, modernisation of Mongla Port and
water management during the four-day tour that begins on March 26.
""This would be a very successful, productive, and milestone visit with some
announcements,"" Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen told the media
after a meeting with Foreign Secretary Jashim Uddin at the foreign ministry
yesterday.
Dhaka will be making the same proposals as it did during Foreign Adviser Touhid
Hossain's visit to China in January, said Mahfuz Kabir, research director at the
Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS).
During Touhid's January visit, he had requested lowering the interest rate on
Chinese loans from 2-3 percent to 1 percent, waiving the commitment and
management fees and extending the loan repayment period from 20 years to 30
years for both the preferential buyer's credit and government concessional loans.
The Chinse side had agreed in principle to extend the repayment period for
Chinese loans and assured Dhaka of looking into the request to lower the interest
rate.
However, it all depends on the strength of the negotiations, Kabir said.
""There could be some MoUs signed, but substantial boost in trade and investment
or concessions in loans will largely depend on political stability, even though
China maintains relations with any government of the time,"" said Imtiaz Ahmed,
also a former professor of Dhaka University's international relations department.
Attracting Chinese investment to Bangladesh's Special Economic Zone in
Chattogram will be a major agenda, said foreign ministry officials.
Bangladesh will encourage Chinese companies to relocate their factories to
Bangladesh, especially the sunset companies as China faces global trade barriers,
Chief Adviser's Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam told the media last week.
If these companies manufacture in Bangladesh, they can export without
restrictions, he said.
China is the Bangladesh's largest trading partner, with the volume being $25
billion a year. However, Bangladesh's exports to China amount to less than $1
billion, though China provides Bangladesh with zero-tariff market access.
As part of the efforts to narrow the trade gap, China will be importing mango,
guava, and jackfruit in big quantities, Yao said.
A new area of cooperation began with China since Touhid's visit in medical
tourism, at a time when India has substantially tightened visas for Bangladeshis.
He had requested China to dedicate hospitals for Bangladeshi patients in
Kunming. The first batch of 14 patients went to China in early March this year.
Dhaka has also proposed that China should set up a high-quality hospital chain in
Bangladesh, a proposal that is being positively considered by China, a foreign
ministry official said.
The establishment of high-quality hospitals in Bangladesh will be a milestone in
Sino-Bangla relations, Prof said.
River water management will be another agenda during Yunus' visit, according to
foreign ministry officials.
In 2023, China proposed implementing the Teesta river management project in
phases, but Bangladesh did not go ahead with it.
Yao recently told the media that China was ready to implement the project.
Dhaka may also raise the issue of China's plan to build a mega-hydropower dam
across the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which can have implications on the
lower riparian countries, including India and Bangladesh.
According to the officials concerned, China will propose that Bangladesh should
join the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative.
Dhaka may not go for any project that stoke geopolitical tension, said Kabir of
BIISS.
""Also, the fact that this is an interim government, it may think twice before going
for any such issue,"" he added.
Dhaka will definitely seek China's strong role in addressing the Rohingya crisis
that has become complicated with the Arakan Army taking control of about 90
percent of Rakhine state, said a foreign ministry official.
""Something like the Marshall Plan is required for addressing the Rohingya crisis,
and a global or regional approach would work better towards this end. Similarly,
there may be a consortium of different countries to address the Teesta water
issue,"" Prof Imtiaz said.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/291804/chinese-fm-wang-in-dhaka-to-elevate-ties-to-a-new 1/4State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi arrived in Dhaka on Saturday afternoon to discuss
bilateral, regional and global issues with Bangladesh leadership with a hope to elevate the
relationship with Bangladesh to a new level.
Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque received the Chinese Foreign Minister upon
his arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport around 5:18pm, a senior official told UNB.
Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen and Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming were
present at the airport.
From the airport, Minister Wang was heading towards Bangabandhu Memorial Museum at
Dhanmondi-32 to pay tribute to Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam will receive the Chinese Foreign Minister at
the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum at 6pm Saturday.
Awami League General Secretary and Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader is
scheduled to host a dinner in honour of the Chinese Foreign Minister on Saturday evening.
“We hope the visit will provide an opportunity to further implement the common understandings
between the leaders of the two countries, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation and elevate the
relationship to a new level,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying.
She said they “highly value” their relationship with Bangladesh and the Chinese Foreign Minister
is visiting Bangladesh at the invitation of Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen.
Minister Wang is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday morning apart from
holding a bilateral meeting with his Bangladesh counterpart Momen the same day.
The meeting between Foreign Minister Momen and his Chinese counterpart Wang is scheduled to
begin at 7:30am (beginning with breakfast) at Sonargaon Hotel.
“They will have an exchange of views on bilateral relations and international and regional issues
of shared interest,” said Chinese Spokesperson Chunying.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/291804/chinese-fm-wang-in-dhaka-to-elevate-ties-to-a-new 2/4Bangladesh will likely deepen both its economic links with China and its security links with India
in the long term in order to avoid becoming a full client state of either, according to geopolitical
risk analysis site - Foreign Brief.
Potential topics include the expansion of Chinese foreign direct investment and the handover of
the eighth Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge to the Bangladeshi government, it said.
Almost a third of Bangladesh’s imports come from China, and China has promised to invest $40
billion into joint ventures and infrastructure projects through the Belt and Road Initiative, it
added.
“This is going to be different from other bilateral visits. I can’t tell you in detail at this moment as
many things are still under last minute discussion,” another official familiar with the development
told UNB, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Foreign Minister Momen is expected to return home Saturday night from Cambodia after
attending the Asean Regional Forum meeting.
Talking to reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday, Shahriar Alam said
Bangladesh and China are likely to sign multiple MoUs and agreements during Wang’s visit.
He said the list is not finalized yet and it can be five-seven – new and renewal including
cooperation on the disaster management and cultural exchange fronts.
Shahriar assured that the planned MoUs and agreements will be aligned with Bangladesh’s
cultural, social and economic policy though the list is not finalized yet.
The state minister said the relationship between Bangladesh and China is “deep and wide” and
the two countries will discuss areas of future cooperation.
Responding to a question, the state minister said Bangladesh will seek a stronger role from the
Chinese government for early repatriation of the Rohingyas.
Bangladesh is hosting over 1.1 million Rohingyas and there is a tripartite mechanism –
Bangladesh, Myanmar and China – to discuss and resolve the crisis.
In January 2017, Wang had an hour-long stopover in Dhaka. This time, he is coming for a longer
period.
The Chinese foreign minister is likely to leave Dhaka for Mongolia soon after his meeting with
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

in the region while experts suggest Bangladesh to ensure a strategic balance amid these tensions.
Earlier, Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen said taking a new loan from China will not be a
part of their agenda during the Chinese foreign minister's Bangladesh visit.
""This time, the issue of taking loan afresh isn't there at least,"" he said on Wednesday when a
reporter wanted to know whether Bangladesh is going to take a loan from China again.
Asked what message this visit carries amid the crisis in various parts of the world, the foreign
secretary said it will be known once the Chinese foreign minister comes.
He reiterated that the visit is part of the Chinese side's routine visit to the region and also it is an
opportunity to review the existing engagements between the two countries.
Wang is a member of the 19th CPC Central Committee, State Councilor and a member of the
Leading CPC Members Group of the State Council.
From Dhaka, the Chinese Foreign Minister will visit Mongolia at the invitation of Mongolian
Foreign Minister Battsetseg Batmunkh.

Update : 22 Jun 2022, 12:47 PM
On June 3, the director general of the Department of Asian Affairs of
China’s Foreign Ministry, Liu Jinsong, invited Bangladesh
Ambassador to China Mahbub Uz Zaman for a meeting.
There, Liu told Zaman, “China believes that countries in the region,
including Bangladesh, will bear in mind the fundamental interests of
their own countries and the region, uphold independence, reject the
Cold War mentality and bloc politics,” as reported by Dhaka
Tribune.[1] 
Bangladesh is not joining any new political grouping; the Cold War
ended three decades ago; Bangladesh has been an independent
country since 1971. Zaman would have had no reason to protest.
But, of course, Liu was asking Zaman to consider the consequence of
collaborating with the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for
Prosperity (IPEF), after the media reported that US representatives

x25/05/2025, 15:02 The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is not an anti-China ploy
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/272754/the-indo-pacific-economic-framework-is-not-an 2/10had briefed their Bangladeshi counterparts on the initiative over the
last several months.[2] 
Liu’s warning is one reason many journalists and commentators have
framed the IPEF as the US response to China’s economic interests in
Asia, which include the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and the
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the largest
economic trade bloc in the world.
This framing, however, overlooks fundamental differences between
the IPEF and other initiatives. 
The BRI and IPEF  are like apples and
oranges
The BRI is effectively a Beijing-led roadshow for state-owned
engineering firms and development banks. 
The BRI is the banner under which a wide variety of companies from
China pursue funding from their own banks to build, and if they are
lucky, operate, hard infrastructure in developing countries. 
Beijing issues guidelines for the BRI that indicate what countries,
sectors, and projects it will support; regulatory bodies develop
frameworks that encourage companies and banks to follow
guidelines; companies, banks, and governments in China and partner
countries design and build projects. 
The IPEF focuses on trade and governance, not loans and
construction like the BRI.[3][4] 
The closest US foreign policy effort to the BRI is the Blue Dot
Network (BDN) implemented by the US, Japan, and Australia in
2019, not the IPEF. And the BDN’s scope is comparatively limited. 
The BDN certifies infrastructure projects in developing countries as
sustainable; this certification may then help developers attract
foreign investment for the project.[5] ব না নী েত

x25/05/2025, 15:02 The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is not an anti-China ploy
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/272754/the-indo-pacific-economic-framework-is-not-an 3/10The BDN has not made much of an impact because of its inability to
promise financing. 
While the US, Japan, and Australia -- all IPEF members -- could
attempt to strengthen the BDN under the IPEF, the BDN ultimately
serves a different purpose from the BRI. Where the BRI promises
fast cash for infrastructure projects, the BDN promises international
quality standards for infrastructure projects.
The RCEP  is not ‘Chinese’
The IPEF shares more similarities with the RCEP than the BRI. That
is because the IPEF could evolve into a trade agreement like the
RCEP. 
The RCEP is a multilateral agreement like the IPEF. The RCEP
includes Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, in
addition to all ASEAN-member states. 
Despite this, the media has often portrayed the RCEP as “Chinese.”
This is because China has the largest economy in the RCEP, and
many RCEP-critics portray trade with China as threatening. 
Yet, every RCEP member weighed the cost-benefit of implementing
the agreement over nearly 10 years of negotiations, and joined on
terms they saw as favourable. 
And after it all, Japan retains the most favourable trade balance
within the RCEP, not China.[6] 
No one ever describes the RCEP as a Japan-led or -dominated trade
group, but if they did, it might be less surprising that most RCEP
member states are also members of the new IPEF. 
Still, the most useful comparison for the IPEF isn’t even the RCEP.
It’s the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership (CPTPP). 
The CPTPP is a trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada,
Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and
 x25/05/2025, 15:02 The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is not an anti-China ploy
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/272754/the-indo-pacific-economic-framework-is-not-an 4/10Vietnam. Many CPTPP members participate in both the RCEP and
IPEF. 
The CPTPP actually started as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). 
US representatives spent years developing the TPP before then US
president Donald Trump withdrew in 2016, prompting the TPP’s
remaining members to re-draft the agreement as the CPTPP. 
Analysts, generally, portray the CPTPP as a lighter version of the
original TPP, as the CPTTP contains tariff and non-tariff measures
negotiated between the US and other CPTPP participants under the
TPP. 
The CPTPP, then, offers the most direct precedent for the IPEF,
which will likely serve as a basis for the IPEF to build on the non-
tariff trade measures discussed during TPP negotiations. 
Beijing’ s ‘view fr om nowher e’
The IPEF, ultimately, reflects the shared interests of its participants,
many of whom have worked together since the turn of the century to
deepen and enrich economic ties between each other. 
And Liu’s effort to depict the IPEF as a Cold War-era political
grouping that subjugates countries like Bangladesh was as absurd as
it was disingenuous.
Dhaka is free to pursue any combination of bilateral and multilateral
agreements it would like. 
Beijing’s representatives will continue to issue opaque warnings, but
they are just that – warnings. Dhaka has managed similar warnings
in the past, just as counterparts throughout Southeast Asia, many of
whom are members of the BRI, BDN, RCEP, CPTPP, and now, the
IPEF.[7][8]

Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen has observed that many countries share the same
position with Beijing in safeguarding the national sovereignty and independence of Bangladesh
and opposing external interference during the election period. In an interview with Dhaka
Tribune’s Diplomatic Correspondent Nurul Islam Hasib recently, the envoy shared his
observations about Dhaka as he completed a little more than one year of his assignment. He said
China is truly committed to helping Bangladesh in its development and construction.
Dhaka Tribune: You have completed a year in Dhaka. What has surprised you in terms of
what you expected to see?
Yao Wen: How time flies. It has been one year and two months since I came to Dhaka. The past
year has been very important in the history of Bangladesh and also for the China-Bangladesh
Strategic Partnership of Cooperation. I would like to share with you some observations that
impressed me most.
First, the Bangladeshi people are very friendly towards China. Over the past year, I have visited
many places in Bangladesh, had extensive contacts with all sectors of society, and reached out to
the grass-roots people.
What I have experienced most is the simple and sincere affection of the Bangladeshi people
towards China and the Chinese people. According to the survey on the National Image of China,Publish : 16 Mar 2024, 09:00 AM
x25/05/2025, 15:14 Ambassador: Many countries align with China in backing Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/341899/ambassador-many-countries-align-with-china-in 2/7which has been conducted for two consecutive years, over 90% of the respondents are satisfied
with the status quo of China-Bangladesh relations and support further development. And the
percentage of people holding the same position is increasing. I have to say that people-to-people
affection is deeply rooted in the thousand-year-long history of friendly exchanges between the
two countries. And it is nurtured by the common principles of mutual respect, equality, and win-
win cooperation between the two sides. China is truly committed to helping Bangladesh in its
development and construction, and hopes that the Bangladeshi people could enjoy a happier life.
Second, Bangladesh has great potential for development. Let me cite a set of figures to prove it.
At the time of the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, its GDP was only $6.29 billion, with a
growth rate of negative 14% and a per capita GDP of only $90.7.
After 50 years of development, in 2022, its GDP exceeded $460 billion, with a growth rate of
7.1%, and an average annual growth rate of more than 6% over the past decade.
Per capita GDP is nearly $2,800, surpassing India for four consecutive years and Pakistan for
eight consecutive years. In addition to the achievements in the economic field, the level of
development in the social and welfare fields in Bangladesh has also improved significantly.
Bangladesh is the first country in South Asia to join the Belt and Road Initiative. Over the past
eight years, the BRI has taken root and blossomed in the golden Bay of Bengal, being involved
in, and witnessing the sweeping changes that have taken place in Bangladesh.
It is with no exaggeration that the city of Dhaka looks like a big construction site, and is vibrant
and alive with new projects every single day. Fourteen mega infrastructure projects aided or
constructed by the Chinese government have been completed or commenced during the past year,
making significant contributions to improving people's livelihoods and upgrading infrastructure
conditions in Bangladesh.
With the continuous strengthening of China-Bangladesh Strategic Partnership of Cooperation and
the deepening of practical cooperation in various fields, China will continue to provide support
and assistance for the development of Bangladesh and help Bangladesh achieve “Vision 2041”
and ""Smart Bangladesh"" at an early date.
The general election was a major issue during your tenure. China was quite vocal against
Western statements on Bangladesh in the run-up to the elections. Washington said they
were helping Bangladesh in the democratic process. Beijing called it internal interference.
Why did you think that?
x25/05/2025, 15:14 Ambassador: Many countries align with China in backing Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/341899/ambassador-many-countries-align-with-china-in 3/7China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace, in which non-interference in other
countries' internal affairs is an important principle. On the issue of the 12th National Parliament
Election, the Chinese Government maintained a consistent position with a clear and firm attitude.
We have always believed that the election is an internal affair that should not be subject to any
external interference. How Bangladesh will develop in the future, nobody but the Bangladeshi
people have the say. We are glad to see that the election was finally conducted smoothly as
scheduled despite tremendous pressure and challenges.
Chinese leaders sent the letters of congratulations to the Hon’ble Prime Minister immediately
after the election, indicating that they stand ready to work with the Bangladeshi side to uplift the
China-Bangladesh Strategic Partnership of Cooperation to a new height.
What I would like to point out is that there are many countries that share the same position with
China, supporting Bangladesh in safeguarding national sovereignty and independence, opposing
external interference and standing firmly on the side of the people of Bangladesh. On the
contrary, some certain countries are interfering in the name of democracy, as if their democracy
and elections are superior and perfect. Is that the truth? The people of Bangladesh see it clearly.
Chinese railway technology is world class: do you see any prospect of Bangladesh being
linked from top to bottom with a high-speed rail network?
Railway cooperation is an important part of China-Bangladesh relations and has achieved fruitful
results in recent years. Last year, Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina attended the
inauguration ceremony of the Dhaka-Bhanga section of Padma Bridge rail link and the Railway
Line from Dohazari to Cox's Bazar built by Chinese enterprises. Up to now, Chinese companies
have built seven railways in Bangladesh. These mega projects play an important role in
Bangladesh's economic and social development and help to provide job opportunities to local
people.
China has rich experiences and advanced technologies in railway construction. China stands
ready to strengthen communication and cooperation with Bangladesh, and is willing to be deeply
involved in Bangladesh railway construction. Should the Bangladeshi side have new suggestions
of cooperation, please feel free to formally submit to the Chinese side.
How should Bangladesh manage its geopolitical relations given the increasing tensions
between the US and China?
Major countries shoulder critical responsibilities for global strategic stability. As President Xi
Jinping noted, major-country competition is not the prevailing trend of current times. For major

coordination; the more acute the risks and challenges, the greater the need to advance
cooperation. China will be a force for stability in promoting cooperation between major
countries.
This year marks the 45th anniversary of China-US diplomatic relations. Past experience and
lessons show that when China and the United States work together, great things can be
accomplished for the two countries and the entire world, while a confrontational posture between
the two countries hurts both sides and the world at large. At the end of last year, the Chinese and
US presidents held an important summit meeting, which laid out a future-oriented San Francisco
vision. In the meantime, China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests and push
back against containment and suppression. With a sense of responsibility for history, for the
people and for the world, China will work with the United States to implement the common
understandings between the two presidents and move bilateral relations forward along the right
path of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.
Dr Hasan Mahmud, the new Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, affirms his adherence to the foreign
policy of “friendship to all, malice towards none”, with importance to be laid on both the East
and the West. This is appreciated by the Chinese side.
Two-way trade is growing. But it's obviously in favour of China. Do you have any plans to
balance the trade? Any plans to sign an FTA with Bangladesh?
In recent years, bilateral trade between China and Bangladesh has developed rapidly. China has
maintained Bangladesh's largest trading partner for the past 13 consecutive years, and Bangladesh
is also China's third largest trading partner in South Asia. The trade structures of the two
countries are complementary and have played a positive role in the economic development of
both countries.
I understand that many Bangladeshi friends pay attention to the trade imbalance between China
and Bangladesh. Let me share with you the data. In 2023, Bangladesh's trade deficit with China
dropped by 15%, indicating that the trade imbalance condition between China and Bangladesh
has been effectively improved.
As you said, China-Bangladesh trade is in favour of China, but Bangladesh has also gained huge
benefits from it. On one hand, 85% of Bangladesh's exports are RMG, and about 80% of the raw
materials come from China. It is China-Bangladesh trade that ensures the production and export
of Bangladesh's RMG, thereby helping Bangladesh to realize the export diversification strategy.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/341899/ambassador-many-countries-align-with-china-in 5/7On the other hand, a large part of China's exports to Bangladesh are machinery and parts, which
ensures Bangladesh's infrastructure construction needs, thereby promoting Bangladesh's
economic development and increasing employment. Therefore, I can say that China-Bangladesh
trade is mutually beneficial.
China has never pursued a trade surplus with Bangladesh. In recent years, China has taken
pragmatic measures to expand imports from Bangladesh. This year, Bangladesh mango is
expected to be exported to China. China welcomes Bangladesh to actively participate in the CIIE,
the Canton Fair, etc., and supports Bangladesh in holding jute, leather and other special product
exhibitions in China to promote more Bangladeshi high-quality products to enter the Chinese
market.
I am also very happy to see that Bangladeshi media friends are paying attention to the China-
Bangladesh FTA. Signing of the China-Bangladesh FTA will help Bangladesh successfully
graduate from LDCs in 2026, import Chinese products needed for Bangladesh's economic
development and industrial upgrading, and also ensure export of Bangladeshi high-quality
products to China, such as jute, leather, mango, and aquatic products. Meanwhile, the China-
Bangladesh FTA will also strengthen investment cooperation between the two countries, helping
Bangladesh to attract more Chinese investment, and promote Bangladesh’s economic and social
development. China hopes to work with Bangladesh to complete the feasibility study on the FTA,
and formally kick off the negotiations as early as possible, so as to sign it before 2026.
Do you see any prospect of Rohingya repatriation? What’s the current situation in
Myanmar alongside the repatriation?
With China's unremitting efforts and continuous mediation, Bangladesh and Myanmar have been
working together and made significant progress since last April, sending out goodwill to each
other and making a series of agreements on the commencement of repatriation. Both sides
achieved unprecedented progress. For example, the Bangladeshi side sent a “go & see”
delegation to Myanmar to inspect the situation of the resettlement villages, and the Myanmar side
sent two “come & talk” delegations to Bangladesh, and both sides jointly carried out identity
verification of displaced people.
What I would like to emphasize is that repatriation is the only solution to the issue. And this is
widely recognized by all the parties concerned. It is only a matter of time for the repatriation to
commence. Although repatriation has been suspended for the time being due to the internal
conflict in Myanmar, the parties concerned remain determined to carry forward the repatriation
process.

China's commercial and cultural influence on the Muslim world, including Bangladesh, is
noticeable. Over the past few decades, China has not only been conducting economic
activities with Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, India, Vietnam and Myanmar. China's
trade relations with almost all countries in the Middle East are very warm and long-lasting.
Now there is no country in the world where China does not have a variety of products.BN

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/analysis/china-a-development-partner-of-bangladesh-1622824911 1/9China has already been able to establish its strong position in the market of all kinds of
products around the world.
China's big strategy is that China never interferes in the internal politics of any country.
So China easily develops good relations with any country and those relations are long
lasting. China puts its own business interests first. On the other hand, Bangladesh is in a
strategic position of geopolitics. Therefore, India and the United States have the same
interest in Bangladesh as China. China-Bangladesh relations are very old. China's
diplomatic relations with Bangladesh were established in 1976, long after the country
became independent. In 1950 and 1960, the then Prime Minister of China, Zhou Enlai,
visited East Pakistan twice. In 1957, Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani visited China. Later, Awami
League President Hossain Shaheed Suhrawardy visited China in 1957 as the Prime Minister
of Pakistan. In 1976, President Ziaur Rahman established close ties with China. Later,
President Ershad's visit to China in 1987 led to the development of China-Bangladesh
relations. When Begum Khaleda Zia was the Prime Minister, the Chinese Prime Minister
Jiabao visited Bangladesh. In 2005, both countries declared ""Bangladesh China Friendship
Year "". In 2007, China donated 1.0 million US dollars for the first time to the victims of the
cyclone. At present, China-Bangladesh relations are very good. The two countries are
moving forward economically, socially and culturally through multidimensional
cooperation. Bangladesh-China relations are business-related. In 1997, the first company
called Power China came forward to invest in the power sector in Bangladesh. Over the past
few years, more than 20 Chinese companies have been investing in Bangladesh. Power
China Company is currently working on 14 projects. The investment in this case is about
4.70 billion US dollars. The company continues to work in the planning, design, project,
operations and maintenance sectors.
As a non-Muslim big neighbour, China is a big partner in our development. Bangladesh-
China diplomatic relations are 45 years old. The current relationship is at an all-time high.
Bangladesh-China International Conference Centre is a beautiful, eye-catching, important
establishment, an example of Sino-Bangladesh relations which is located in Sher-e-Bangla
Nagar. We have been benefiting from that installation for a long time. The present name is
Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. It was established in 2001. Launched in
2002 the cost was 5.0 million US dollars. The Chinese government later donated the entire
hall to Bangladesh. This is a great example of China's friendship.
According to the news published in the newspaper on June 7, 2020, the government of
Bangladesh has undertaken 17 development projects on a priority basis. The estimated
cost of all these projects is 11.5 million US dollars.
The projects prepared on the basis of the said priority have been taken up by China-Bangla
Investment Corporation for the first time. 17 development projects have been sent to the
Chinese government for approval for investment.
Of the 17 projects, three are in the power sector. The cost of the project Power Grid
Strengthening Project is estimated at 960 million US dollars. The cost of the Over loaded25/05/2025, 14:15 China: A development partner of Bangladesh | The Financial Express

System loss rejection project is estimated at 200 million US dollars.
Bangladesh Railway has four development projects. The Joydebpur-Ishwardi double line
project cost is estimated at 1045.59 million US dollars. Akhaura- Sylhet meter gauge line will
be converted to a double-gauge line which is the second railway development project. The
cost of the project is estimated at 1272.9 million US dollars. The third development project
is the construction of Joydebpur-Mymensingh-Jamalpur double gauge line at a cost of
581.28 million US dollars. The fourth railway development project is construction of Inland
Container depot. The cost is estimated at 200 million US dollars.
Two development projects have been placed under the Roads Department. The first is
Dhaka- Expressway. The cost is estimated at 1155.18 million US dollars. The second is the
Sitakunda-Cox's Bazar Marine Drive Expressway project. The cost of the project is estimated
at 2856.56 million US dollars.
The Ministry of ICT has two of the 17 development projects. The first project is the Digital
Conductivity project. The cost of the project could be 837 million US dollars. The second
project is to improve the quality of life of the people in urban and rural areas by using ICT.
The estimated cost of the project is 500 million US dollars.
One of the projects has been taken up by the Ministry of Information on a priority basis. The
project is to build six full-fledged TV stations. The cost of the project is estimated at 125
million US dollars.
There are two projects under the Ministry of Local Government. The first is the construction
of Rajshahi WASA water treatment plant. The estimated cost is 276 million US dollars. The
second project under the Ministry of Local Government is the Sanitation and waste
management project for municipal areas. The cost is estimated at 150 million US dollars.
In addition, there are two more development projects. One is the Jute Mill Modernization
Project. The cost is estimated at 280 million US dollars. This project is under the Ministry of
Jute. Besides, the economic zone project in Chattogram will cost 221 million US dollars.
One of the 17 priority projects is under the Ministry of Shipping. That is the Mongla port
modernization project. The cost of the project is estimated at 353.52 million US dollars.
The projects were sent to the Chinese government in June 2020. Already, both the
government and China have begun work to speed up the projects.
If China's ongoing projects and potential projects in the future become visible in
Bangladesh, China and Bangladesh will reach a unique level of relations.
China maintains good relations with South Asian countries and continues its trade strategy.
China has been conducting small to large investment activities with Bangladesh, Pakistan,
Nepal, Bhutan, India, Vietnam and Myanmar. China has long pursued a policy with South
Asian countries that opposes the principle of hegemony and supports a multilateral world
policy. China, with its growing economic power, regional power and global influence, and in
cooperation with other Asian countries, has been contributing to the establishment of
peace and justice in the world. China will play a special role in the international political25/05/2025, 14:15 China: A development partner of Bangladesh | The Financial Express

China's investment and various cooperation in Bangladesh will further deepen China's
relationship with the people of this Muslim-dominated country, which will have a special
impact on our social and economic spheres. With the establishment of industries,
especially in the special industrial zones created by China, the start of production will
create huge employment opportunities in Bangladesh. Millions of workers, employees and
officials will create new fields to earn a lot of foreign exchange. If these 17 development
projects are implemented, the dynamism of the country's economy will increase manifold
and will provide a big boost to growth.

https://bdnews24.com/world/south-east-asia/819a3bb9c33a 2/8More than a third of construction has been completed in the segment connecting the capital Bangkok to the
city of Nakhon Ratchasima, about 220 km away and the whole line to Nong Khai at the border with Laos
would be ready by 2030, said Thai government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub.
A $6 billion, 1000 km rail line from the Laotian capital V ientiane to the southwestern Chinese city of
Kunming began service in 2021, a venture 70% owned by Beijing. That line will connect with Thailand's
Nong Khai via V ientiane, about 25 km away .
""This is an opportunity for Thailand to connect to the global economy ,"" Jirayu said, adding it would bring
Thailand closer to its goal of becoming a logistics hub.
The announcement comes a year after China urged Thailand to progress faster on the rail link.
Discussions on the rail line started nearly two decades ago and Thailand and China signed agreements on
its construction in 2017 with plans to begin operations in 2021. But construction met delays over
disagreements on financing and design, and disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic.25/05/2025, 11:37 Thailand hopes rail link to China to operate from 2030

initiative, which includes plans for three routes originating in Kunming that pass through Myanmar , Thailand
and V ietnam.
Vietnam plans to build a 1,541 km (958-mile) high-speed rail line linking its two biggest cities, Hanoi and Ho

Chinese business leader  tells China-BD Forum
Ismail Hossain, from Beijing | Saturday , 26 May 2018
'China dream' and 'Bangladesh dream' have blended well as both the nations partnered in belt and road
initiative (BRI), a top Chinese entrepreneur has said.
The two countries have great potential for stronger bilateral cooperation, he commented on Friday .25/05/2025, 11:34 BRI to forge ‘closer Sino-Bangla ties’
https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/print/bri-to-forge-closer-sino-bangla-ties-1527270361 1/2Print""Bangladesh is a very important country in BRI. Since President Xi's visit to Bangladesh in 2016, they
established a strategic partnership,"" said Jun Huang, secretary general of China Top 500 Foreign Trade
Enterprises Club, in Beijing.
He said President Xi sought to cooperate with Bangladesh in several major areas like power ,
infrastructure, capacity building and agriculture to for ge stronger bilateral ties.
Huang was speaking at a China-Bangladesh Business Forum organised by Bangladesh High
Commission and Top 500 Foreign Trade Enterprises Club at a Beijing hotel.
Around 40 Chinese entrepreneurs attended the programme.
Speaking at the event, Bangladesh Ambassador in Beijing M Fazlul Karim said China is a major
development partner now involved in multiple infrastructure and power generation projects in
Bangladesh.
Over the years, he said, China has emerged as the largest trading partner of Bangladesh with a trade
volume of more than $12 billion in 2017.
""There exists tremendous potential to further expand trade and investment cooperation. As a bridge
between South and South East Asia, Bangladesh is a very attractive place for foreign direct investment.""
Karim said Bangladesh has qualified for graduating from a least develope d country (LDC) to a
developing country status, reflecting key improvements in both social and economic sectors.
The envoy said the government is in the process of establishing 100 special economic zones (SEZs) and
at least one hi-tech park in each district in the coming years for rapid industrialisation.
""This is expected to transform Bangladesh into a major manufacturing hub in Asia,"" he added.
""...Bangladesh is setting up a special economic zone for Chinese investors in Chittagong, which will be
ready for investment at the end of this year .""
Karim identified shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, garments and textile, agro-processing, light
engineering, ICT , jute, infrastructure, power generation and tourism for Chinese investment.
Commercial counsellor of Bangladesh High Commission Md Mahfuzul Alam Khan, Managing Director
and CEO of Shandong Sinoking Dredging Equipment Co Ltd Wilson Zhao and GEO Bangla Managing
Director Abu Sayed, among others, also spoke at the forum.

Last update on: Tue Oct 1, 2024 07:12 PM
——Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic
of China
H.E. Mr. Yao Wen, Ambassador of China to Bangladesh
October 1, 2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China. On this momentous occasion, on behalf of the Chinese
Embassy in Bangladesh, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude and highest
respect to everyone who has been supporting China's development and the China-
Bangladesh friendship over the years. I also wish to convey my warmest greetings
and sincere regards to all our fellow compatriots living in Bangladesh!
Over the past 75 years, Chinese people have created miracles of achievement.
Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Chinese
nation has achieved the historic leap from standing up, being prosperous to being
strong. The Chinese people has successfully blazed a path of socialism with
Chinese characteristics. China has realized the first centenary goal of building a
moderately prosperous society in all respects. China is marching in confident
strides towards the second centenary goal of building China into a great modern
socialist country in all respects.
Over the past 75 years, China has made tremendous contribution to world
development and prosperity. At present, humanity is confronted with critical
choices of unity and cooperation or division and confrontation, mutual benefit or
zero-sum game, and common security or turbulence and warfare. China has been
ready to work with all stakeholders to build an open, inclusive, clean and
beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common
prosperity. China is determined to implement the Global Development Initiative,
the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, hold high the
banner of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and take steps
forward to build a common homeland for humanity.
Looking back the last decade from 2013 to 2023, China's economy achieved a
medium-to-high annual growth rate of 6.1 percent, contributing to global
economic growth by more than 30 percent on average. This year, China's GDP is
growing by 5 percent year-on-year on a steady, sound and upward trajectory with
the potential of long-term growth. China's development will inject vibrant
impetus into the world economy, providing more development opportunities for
Bangladesh and other countries.
In July this year, the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) successfully concluded its third plenary session, which is a very important
meeting held at a critical juncture of building a great country and advancing
national rejuvenation in the new era. The session adopted the Resolution of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening
Reform Comprehensively, which outlined the overall goal of further deepening
reform and provided a comprehensive action plan and blueprint for China's
future development. We will adhere to achieving the great rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation through Chinese-style modernization and continue to actively
promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. We aim
to bring new opportunities to the world through China's development and
contribute wisdom and strength to world peace, development, and the
advancement of humankind.
China and Bangladesh are traditionally friendly neighbors and Comprehensive
Strategic Cooperative Partners. Our bilateral relations are based on the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, with full respect to the independence,
sovereignty, territorial integrity of Bangladesh. We believe no one but the
Bangladeshi people have the right to choose their path of development. We follow
a policy of good-neighborliness and friendship towards all Bangladeshi people.
Bangladesh firmly upholds the One-China principle, recognizing Taiwan as an
inalienable part of China's territory, and consistently supports China on matters
concerning Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Xizang, and human rights.
No matter what changes have taken place inside Bangladesh, China's
commitment to develop our bilateral relations remains unchanged. China is fully
convinced that our cooperation will sustain healthy and stable momentum of
growth. China sincerely hopes that under the leadership of the interim
government, Bangladesh will carry out state reform, maintain political stability,
advance economic development and improve people's livelihood. To support the
development of Bangladesh, China decides to grant zero-tariff treatment on 100%
of taxable items to Bangladesh, which means China will substantially increase
import of cereals, sugar, edible oil, rubber and rubber products, wood products,
jute and jute products, paper and paper products, wool and cotton from
Bangladesh from 1 December, 2024. China will import Bangladeshi Mangos,
which will benefit the local farmers. To combat the flood, China is providing
rescue facilities and equipment worth of 400,000 US dollars to Bangladesh.
During the last one and half months since the establishment of the interim
government, Chinese enterprises have invested more than 85 million US dollars,
which demonstrates the confidence China holds for the future development of
Bangladesh and our relations. What's more, at the request of the interim
government, China has sent National Emergency Medical Team to Bangladesh to
provide assistance in treatment of those patients injured in the July and August
movement.
The Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership between China and
Bangladesh has brought tangible benefits to the peoples of both nations. Under
the Belt and Road Initiative, China has built 7 railways, 12 highways, 21 bridges,
and 31 power and energy projects in Bangladesh, generating employment for over
550,000 people. The cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two
countries have also deepened significantly, with direct flights now connecting the
capitals of both countries and weekly flights totaling 80, accommodating over
15,000 passengers each week. Nearly 20,000 Bangladeshi students are pursuing
their studies in China. Over the past year, the two Confucius Institutes and one
Confucius Classroom in Bangladesh have provided educational services to nearly
3,000 students.
Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations
between China and Bangladesh, ushering the bilateral relationship into a new
historical phase. China is ready to seize this opportunity to collaborate closely
with Bangladesh, strengthen the traditional friendship between our two nations,
deepen exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation across diverse fields, and
jointly pursue high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, propelling the
Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership between China and Bangladesh
to new heights. Next year is also the ""China-Bangladesh Year of People-to-People
Exchanges"". We will come out with dozens of functions in the sectors of political
exchanges, economic and trade cooperation, culture, education, tourism, sports,
public health, youth, women, media, academic interactions. All the celebrations
aim at improving the friendly relations between us, delivering more benefits to
the peoples of both countries, especially the young people.
A nation will prosper only when its young people thrive. Young people are the
most energetic and full of dreams. Youth are the hope and will be the leaders of
the future. Youth are living in a remarkable time, and enjoy a promising prospect
to fulfill their dreams. I expect the young people to devote themselves into China-
Bangladesh cooperation, passing the torch of friendship from generation to
generation.
Long live China and Bangladesh friendship!",0.147543896,0.366187532,,Positive

Bangladesh shouldn’t worry about debt

Says Chinese envoy
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming has said Bangladesh should never
worry about bad debt or the so-called debt trap.
Chinese Ambassador Li Jiming. Photo: Collected
""I would say that you've managed foreign debt very, very well, and there's no such
bad debt so far at all. You've earned a very, very high credit [recognition]
internationally in terms of [managing] international debts. So, never worry about
that,"" he said.
The envoy made the remarks while responding to a question at an online
symposium titled ""Bangladesh-China Relations: Prognosis for the Future"" hosted
by the Cosmos Foundation on Thursday evening.
The example of Sri Lanka came up in the context of a country that fell into a ""debt
trap"" as a result of public investment projects financed by China.
Ambassador Li, who delivered the keynote speech at the programme, however
said there was no proven evidence that China created any ""debt trap"" in any
country, including Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
""I think you've an excellent system and you've excellent officials and ministers to
take care of that. So, never worry about that,"" he said.
Referring to an article he read regarding Sri Lanka's debt situation, the Chinese
envoy said the total Chinese debt accounts for only less than 8 percent of the
whole debt of that country and of this 8 percent, much less is related to the Belt
and Road projects.
The ambassador also said there is government-to-government debt, which is
normally a soft, concessional loan with a very low interest late and very long
repayment period.
CPD Distinguished Fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya said China has emerged as a
big financial investor in Bangladesh involving major projects which have major
infrastructural implications.
Now there is a debated issue across the world whether this kind of a financial
flow is a ""debt trap"" for the countries like Bangladesh as it happened in Sri Lanka,
he said.
""Thankfully, Bangladesh's external debt remains moderately manageable and
most of the country's debts are from the multinational agencies and at this
moment it is not China.""
The economist, however, said they should be really mindful about the debt
repayment issue although they are in a comfortable position at this stage.
Bangladesh's total outstanding debt burden is well under 40 percent of its GDP. 
""But there are projections that this debt issue would be a challenging point for the
Bangladesh-China relationship beyond 2024,"" he added.
Ambassador Li said Bangladesh and China need to advance the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI). He said there is no doubt that closer cooperation under BRI will
strengthen strategic partnership of cooperation.
Bangladesh is the first South Asian country to sign up for BRI, which was first
proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013.
The Chinese envoy said China never took India as a ""strategic rival"", rather
considered India a good neighbour of the country.
He said the two countries are maintaining good relations for more than 2,000 to
3,000 years. ""Any Chinese intellectual, who is well-educated, would have a special
feeling. A good feeling, towards India -- that's something untold publicly
probably.""
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
Responding to a question about technology transfer, the ambassador said there
are more and more technology transfers happening between China and
Bangladesh.
He mentioned that a couple of years ago, China was not used to purchasing any
garment from Bangladesh. But these days, he said, a lot of readymade garment
products are being exported to China from Bangladesh.
The envoy said China and Bangladesh even can probably work together on space
technology in future.
TEESTA PROJECT
Asked about the Teesta river project, the ambassador said competent authorities
of Bangladesh did put up a proposal to China for the project,but the proposal was
too simple.
""I would say please make a more complete feasibility study report, and only after
that, we can start to assess it to make an evaluation,"" he added.
Cosmos Foundation Chairman Enayetullah Khan delivered the opening and
concluding remarks at the event, chaired by former adviser to the last caretaker
government Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury.
Among the discussants were ambassador (retd) Tariq A Karim, former foreign
secretary Shamsher M Chowdhury, former ambassador Serajul Islam and Prof
Rashed Al Mahmud Titumir of Dhaka University.",0.131454422,0.371746259,,Positive

China needs to change perception about
BRI
Mon Nov 13, 2023 11:20 PM
Last update on: Tue Nov 14, 2023 12:36 AM
China needs to change the perception that projects under its Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) cause debt-trap, corruption to establish itself as a global power,
said economists and international relations analysts.
They said projects under the BRI need to follow the principles of transparency,
good governance, and peoples' participation for them to be more acceptable.
Photo: Star
The observations came at a seminar titled ""BRI and Bangladesh"" organised by the
Centre for Alternatives (CA) at a city hotel today.
Bangladesh became a signatory to the BRI in 2016, three years after China
launched the global infrastructure development initiative connecting Asia,
Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Since then, China helped build 12 highways,
21 bridges, and 27 power and energy projects in Bangladesh.
Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), which was only $19 million in 2009 now
stands at $1.3 billion.
Song Yang, economic and commercial counsellor of Chinese embassy in Dhaka,
said China will be the largest foreign direct investor in Bangladesh soon.
He said the spirit of BRI is collaboration, peace, openness and mutual benefits.
He said China will be a responsible partner in Bangladesh's development.
CA Executive Director Prof Dr Imtiaz Ahmed said Chinese infrastructure projects
are linked to stability against the notion of instability. Some aspects, however,
need to be considered.
""Whenever BRI projects are considered, there should be an extra focus on the
benefits of the locals,"" he said.
Clarity is also needed on how quickly and efficiently the [debt] receiving country
can meet the repayment conditions, he said.
He said there should be more interaction with civil society bodies in making them
aware of the pros and cons of the BRI projects so that no group can willfully
politicise the projects for their own interests.
""The only way to debunk the 'debt trap theory' is by making BRI investments
demonstrably helpful and profitable to the common people of the receiving
country,"" Prof Imtiaz said.
He noted that Bangladesh can be an ideal place for ushering cooperation between
BRI and US' Indo-Pacific Strategy members.
This will make a difference for millions of people in the region.
Prof Rashed Al Mahmud Titumir of University of Dhaka's Department of
Development Studies said, in the context of global powers competing in the Indo-
Pacific region, all need to be careful so that there is no zero-sum game.
""If you turn the region into conflict zone, investments will be at risk,"" he said.
""China will have to ensure that the political and civil rights and human rights are
respected as it comes up with more investments under the BRI,"" Prof Titumir
said.
As there is growing nationalism in the major Asian powers, China has to practice
more internationalism as it goes ahead with global plan of development and
peace, he added.
Dhaka University International Relations Prof ASM Ashraf Ali said it is time to see
how its projects are planned and implemented, if the cost-benefit analysis is done
and how transparent the bidding process is or if there is corruption.
""Ensuring good governance is a must for success of the BRI,"" he said.",0.151175214,0.333760684,,Positive

Belt and Road Initiative -- a critical analysis

The Asia Pacific region appears to be enthralled by China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
which is basically aimed at developing infrastructure in the participating countries.
According to Eric Brown, Research analyst of the Geopolitical Economic Risk, Belt and Road
Initiative promises to link China to both neighbouring and distant regions along its
southern and western frontiers through a massive infrastructure investment project,
including roads, rail lines, ports, energy pipelines and digital networks. BRI promises to
spend one trillion dollars which is several times larger than the Marshall Plan undertaken
for the rejuvenation of the European economy. In total, the BRI incorporates more than 60
countries (figures vary), affects nearly 62 per cent of the world's population and includes
more than 30 per cent of global gross domestic product. Yet despite its impressive metrics,
the project still satisfies only a fraction of the larger infrastructure demand in the region.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that the continent will require more than $26
trillion of investment between 2016 and 2030.
The international community is aware of the trade tussle between the USA and China that
may trigger a global recession. That aside, BRI may aim to supplant a China-led economic
sphere in Eurasia in place of the West-led economic system that continues to rule the world
since the Second World War.
Critics opine that the Bretton Woods institutions and allied others have been rule-based
and legally enforceable system while China's activities in South China Sea appear to be
muscular and has sown disquiet in the adjoining countries who also lay claim on the
disputed areas. It is further said that notwithstanding the existing proposal, the specific
physical and conceptual margins of the BRI remain ambiguous. There is no clear timeline
for completion, and some projects that began prior to the official launch date are included
retroactively. Physical infrastructure projects are complimented with intangibles like trade
accords, cultural exchanges, tourism and educational connections. In addition toBN

include electronic, space, and polar elements. Besides, little progress has been made
except China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which too is not well accepted in Pakistan.
Any international initiative to be successful has to be mutually advantageous to the parties
concerned. In case of China, BRI would facilitate export of overcapacity of equipment, steel
and cement; internalisation of Chinese currency; diversification of energy trade; rural
economic development of western and southern regions of China which have not benefited
from the phenomenal economic growth of China over decades. BRI is also expected to
benefit China in improving foreign market diversification and competitiveness, and most
importantly in the emergence of a central political and economic power in Eurasia.
Naturally, questions would arise about funding of BRI projects. Asia Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) comprising 93 member states, a competing structure of IBRD and
IMF- and New Development Bank (NDP) comprising of BRICS countries are expected to
promote sustainable development and infrastructure projects of the member countries.
The US from the very beginning was unhappy over the establishment of AIIB as it did not
want another multilateral development bank to appear as a rival to ADB and World Bank.
More so, the US and Europe were averse to the authoritarian system of governance of
China.  The West can take heart from the conclusion of Manixin Pei (China's Trapped
Transition) in which Pei theorises that China has reached a phase in which its growth is
stagnant. China's political system, Pei argues, cannot be reformed because of its deep-
rooted corruption issues and due to the lack of institutional infrastructure to address these
issues. Pei labels China's situation as ""self-destructive political dynamics inherent in an
autocracy caught up in rapid socioeconomic change.""  Fareed Zakaria refers to the well
known belief of scholars that   there is a ""zone of transition"" for authoritarian countries
when this happens - between $5,000 to $10,000 per capita GDP (in purchasing power
terms). China is at the top of the range, around $10,000. Given China's level of economic,
social and educational development, it is highly unusual that China, among Asian nations,
has seen almost no movement toward political reform.  Manixin Pei attributes this lack of
movement to a corrupt yet unified Communist Party which zealously guard against any
encroachment on its powers. So, the Hong Kong protests are unlikely to produce an Eastern
European deluge leading to the demise of Soviet Union. More likely it may result in another
Tiananmen Square. China's open handed policy of giving out loans have given rise to ""debt
diplomacy"" as some of the recipients are now unable to pay back the loans. Examples can
be found in the construction of Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, Chinese funded railway link
in Laos. 
There is now a significant move away from strong endorsement of BRI in the initial period
to one of negativity and concern. French President Emmanuel Macron has urged prudence,
suggesting during a trip to China that the BRI could make partner countries ""vassal state. A
report of the Council of Foreign Relations have voiced Indian concern that the BRI  is a plan
to dominate Asia, warning of what some analysts have called a ""String of Pearls"" geo-
economic strategy whereby China creates unsustainable debt burdens for its Indian Ocean
neighbours and potentially takes control of regional choke points. While President Trump
may wish to use India as a counterweight to China, countries like Bangladesh have to follow
a balanced policy vis-à-vis the two countries. Our natural affinity with India
notwithstanding, we have to follow our national interests wherever they lead.

https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/the-impact-of-bangladeshs-general-election-on-bangladesh-china-relations-1550590038 1/8Prime Minister of Bangladesh for the fourth time. On January 03, 2019, her new cabinet
took oath.
During Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's two consecutive terms of ruling from 2009 to 2018,
the government of Bangladesh has made remarkable achievements in governance. The
GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate of the country has remained about 7.0 per cent
in these years. The leadership of Sheikh Hasina for a decade has made Bangladesh one of
the fastest growing economies in the world. At the same time, in 2018, Bangladesh was
officially recognised by United Nations committee on development policy for fulfilling the
criteria for graduation from the least developed country status to a developing country. The
current government has taken over with the aim of furthering these achievements by
turning Bangladesh into a developing country by the upcoming decade. Sheikh Hasina's
another term, therefore, has undoubtedly drawn a great attention from all sides of the
world.
China, as a long-standing development partner of Bangladesh, has been maintaining a
close relationship with the country. Both the countries are time-tested and reliable partners
of cooperation. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries
more than 40 years ago on December 04, 1975, they have established good and stable
relations over the years and their bilateral cooperation in the political, economic, military
and cultural fields has also been deepened. Today, China is not only Bangladesh's largest
source of imports, but has also been its highest trading partner for about two decades.
China and Bangladesh also maintain a close relationship in various regional and
international platforms, such as South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),
World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the United Nations. During President Xi Jinping's visit
to Dhaka in October 2016, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina welcomed him with historic
diplomatic gesture and two countries signed several agreements on different sectors of
cooperation.
Bangladesh is one of the first countries in south Asia to support the construction of the Belt
and Road, and is also an active supporter and participant in the construction of the BCIM
economic corridor. During her visit to China in 2014, Prime Minister Hasina said that, her
country would like to take an active part in the construction of the Belt and Road and the
BCIM economic corridor. Therefore, during China's president Xi Jinping's state visit to
Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina's government officially announced its accession to the Belt and
Road initiative. This shows that, Hasina attaches great importance to the bilateral relations
between Bangladesh and China. We believe that, her reelection will certainly further
cement the friendly relations between Bangladesh and China, and bring greater focus on
the construction of the BCIM economic corridor and the construction of the Belt and Road.25/05/2025, 14:19 The impact of Bangladesh's general election on Bangladesh-China relations | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/the-impact-of-bangladeshs-general-election-on-bangladesh-china-relations-1550590038 2/8China seems to be the largest investment source for Bangladesh in the upcoming years. For
example, during president Xi Jinping's visit to Bangladesh, the two countries signed a $24
billion loan agreement to promote infrastructure construction and optimise the production
capacity structure of Bangladesh. In the future, the two countries will also bring into full
play the huge space and potential for cooperation in the fields of transportation, energy,
power plants, chemical industry and communications. The two countries will further
deepen the friendly and cooperative relations, and will promote common development.
Apart from trade and investment, these two countries have also been cooperating in
cultural and educational sectors. Currently, thousands of Bangladeshi students are
pursuing their higher studies in numerous universities in China with the support of Chinese
government scholarships. The number of Bangladeshi students learning Chinese language
in the Confucius Institutes of public and private universities in Bangladesh is also increasing
substantially. There is a radio station in China, Radio International (CRI) which is dedicated
to the Bengali language as well. These are signs of developing a stronger people-to-people
contact between these two countries, which is expected to go further under the current
government of Bangladesh.  
Bangladesh, with its unique geographical location, is an important fulcrum along the Belt
and Road initiative of China and the BCIM economic corridor. The two countries
complement each other in economic relations and share common strategic aspirations.
This has laid a solid foundation for the development of friendly cooperation between the
two countries. China also attaches great importance to cooperation with Bangladesh. It is
believed that under the leadership of Prime Minister Hasina and the Bangladesh Awami
League, the economic development of Bangladesh will become better and better, the living
standards of the Bangladeshi people will continue to improve, and bilateral relations
between Bangladesh and China will advance steadily.

Foreign adviser’s China tour: Dhaka-
Beijing relations to hit reset button
Mon Jan 20, 2025 12:00 AM
Last update on: Wed Jan 22, 2025 07:00 PM
Say foreign policy experts
Beijing may consider Bangladesh's political stability and diplomatic
positioning before making any commitment on economic and trade benefits
that Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain will seek during his four-day visit to
China, said foreign policy analysts.
""China always emphasises on political stability -- it is unlikely that China will go
for any concrete commitment to new funding or providing trade benefits to the
current interim government that's temporary in nature,"" said Sk Tawfique M
Haque, director of the South Asian Institute of Policy and Governance at North
South University.
During the visit, Dhaka will solicit the lowering of interest rates from 2-3 percent
to 1 percent for Chinese loans, the waiving of loan commitment fees and
extension of the grace period from 15 years to 30 years.
Duty-free access to Bangladeshi products after graduation from the least-
developed country bracket in 2026, more Chinese investments and higher exports
to China will also be sought, The Daily Star has learnt from foreign ministry
officials involved with the proceedings.
Beijing may press Dhaka for joining the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and
try to understand Bangladesh's diplomatic positioning, especially as the interim
government seems to be more pro-Western.
While the Western powers immediately welcomed the political changeover in
Bangladesh in August, China took time to analyse the changed reality here, Haque
said.
""China has overcome its initial inertia and is now normalising the relations with
Bangladesh -- this visit is part of that process,"" he said.
Hossain's visit comes on the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
There might not be new Chinese investment before the political government is in
power, said Munshi Faiz Ahmad, Bangladesh's former ambassador to China.
However, regular trade and economic activities need to be on the right track.
China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner, with the bilateral trade amounting
to $25 billion.
Bangladesh's exports to China, however, are below $1 billion.
China is Bangladesh's fourth-largest lender after Japan, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank.
Chinese loans have surged, exceeding $1 billion annually since 2021-2022. The
total Chinese loans disbursed since 1975 is $7.5 billion.
With the development of a number of mega projects over the last decade,
Bangladesh now faces a huge challenge in foreign debt repayment.
""We would seek the lowering of loan interest rates from the Chinese side to ease
our economic woes,"" Hossain told reporters last week.
During her last visit to China in early July last year, former Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina had sought 36 billion yuan, equivalent to $5 billion, as soft loans from
China, but China had offered only one billion Yuan (about $140 million).
The Chinese offer frustrated Hasina, who was tilted towards India and moved
away from China to India regarding the Teesta river management project.
""Now, Bangladesh is not tilted towards India and should take decisions
independently for national interest,"" Haque said.
Bangladesh is a member of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which the
Western countries term China's geopolitical project.
""So, there should not be a problem for Bangladesh in joining the GDI,"" Haque
said.
The interim nature of the government prevents it from joining the GDI as it has
foreign policy implications, Ahmad said.
A foreign ministry official said apart from lowering of the interest rates,
Bangladesh will seek to speed up the disbursement of loans that have been slow
over the last few months and buy four vessels and railway coaches.
He said Bangladesh will also seek detailed information on China's plan to build a
mega-hydropower dam across the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which can have
implications on the lower riparian countries including India and Bangladesh.
Meanwhile, during a meeting with Hossain at the foreign ministry yesterday,
Chinese Ambassador Yao Wen said they are ready to sign ""implementation plan""
on exchange of hydrological information with Bangladesh during the visit.
Yao also told Hossain that China is ""seriously considering"" lowering its interest
rates for Bangladesh.
Hossain sought Chinese support for developing fruit storage and preservation
capacity in Bangladesh.
He also said Bangladesh is ready to provide land and other logistics for setting up
a full-fledged tertiary-level Chinese hospital in Purbachal.
He also requested China to designate at least three to four top-notch hospitals in
Kunming so that Bangladesh nationals can go there for advanced treatment.
Rohingya issue will also feature prominently during Hossain's visit to Beijing,
especially on improving the conditions in Rakhine State for the Rohingya to
return, Hossain said.
Dhaka needs to engage the Arakan Army (AA) to secure the Bangladesh border
with Myanmar as it is now controlled by the AA, Haque said.
""India and China are both engaging with the Arakan Army. Why not us? We have
greater security issues along the border,"" he said.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/350792/friendly-foreign-policy-the-catalyst-for 1/4Since its inception, Bangladesh's government has followed a foreign policy based on the notion
of ""friendship to all, malice towards none"" -- which Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the
country's founding father, ingrained in the 1972 Constitution. Till today, the country carries on
upholding this diplomatic concept to promote economic development and progress. 
Bangladesh has negotiated difficult international ties by deft diplomatic maneuvers, guaranteeing
friendly relations with world heavyweights like China and India, and fostering economic growth.
With a foreign policy that gives economic diplomacy priority, Bangladesh has established itself
as a major actor on the regional and international stage. The strategic ties developed with
superpowers and neighbours have resulted in significant economic gains, therefore supporting the
national developing path. 
Bangladesh-China
Strong economic cooperation defines Bangladesh's relationship with China. China has made
significant investments in Bangladesh’s mega projects including power plants, and infrastructure
projects like the Padma Bridge and Payra Seaport under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
Along with improving Bangladesh's infrastructure, these projects have generated job
opportunities and consequently stimulated economic development. Crucially important for
ongoing economic development, major infrastructure projects sponsored by Chinese funding
have transformed Bangladesh’s energy and transportation sectors. 
Trade between Bangladesh and China has experienced a gradual increase. With bilateral trade
totalling $24 billion, China is among Bangladesh's biggest trade partners. Technology transfer
made possible by cooperation with Chinese companies has raised local capacities in many
different fields. 
Bangladesh-India
Bangladesh's economic growth has certainly been supported by its diplomatic connection with
India -- which is characterized by historical, cultural, and economic links. From commerce and
investment to security and cultural interaction, the two nations have participated in thorough
collaboration covering all aspects. 
Among the markets, Bangladesh’s exports to India are among the biggest ones. Different trade
agreements, the two nations have signed, have greatly elevated bilateral trade volume though not

Energy security, which is vital for industrial development, has been strengthened in Bangladesh
by sharing energy-related projects. Projects improving regional connectivity, like rail and road
connections, have helped trade and products flow more freely, which has boosted Bangladesh's
economy.

Projects improving regional connectivity , like rail and road connections,

Trade diversity: EU and Middle East
Under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's foreign policy has focused on diversifying
economic alliances to prevent too close a reliance on any one nation. Engaging several nations
and international organizations under this approach has helped to achieve trade agreements
supporting sustainable development as well as investments and aid. 
With the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), Bangladeshi goods have duty-free access to
European markets, hence the EU is a major trading partner. A major source of remittances, labour
exports to the Middle East have helped Bangladesh's economy to flourish. Good working
conditions and pay for Bangladeshi employees have been guaranteed by diplomatic efforts. 
International aid
Bangladesh has skillfully applied initiatives for foreign aid and development to improve its
economic future. The government's foreign policy has made it easier to get financing and
technical help from groups like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Asian
Development Bank (ADB). 
Many initiatives aimed at reducing poverty have been supported by international aid, therefore
raising living standards and boosting local businesses. The investments in education and
healthcare have helped build human capital which is considered to be the foundation of economic
prosperity. Infrastructure developments have been funded by grants and loans from foreign
companies, thus improving economic connectedness and efficiency. 
Achieving a smart balance and prioritizing development

Kazi Anis Ahmed, PublisherAlthough Bangladesh's foreign policy has brought it significant economic gains, it has to
constantly negotiate geopolitical issues, particularly between China and India. Striking a balance
between two ties calls for smart diplomacy so Bangladesh may maximize advantages from both
without becoming caught in regional rivalries. Bangladesh's foreign policy follows its dedication
to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Maintaining the priority of equitable and sustainable economic development calls for ongoing
international collaboration and respect for the norms of other countries. The direction of
Bangladesh's economic growth in the future is much dependent on industrial and technical
progress. Maintaining economic growth will depend critically on strengthening diplomatic
connections with technologically developed countries and supporting innovation and research
cooperation. 
By use of strategic economic diplomacy, Bangladesh has effectively negotiated challenging
foreign ties, guaranteed investments, improved trade, and promoted sustainable development.
Bangladesh's foreign policy will remain a major determinant of its economic destiny as the
country develops, thereby guaranteeing that it stays a vibrant and forward-looking actor on the
international scene.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/329299/dhaka-proposes-us-to-bring-money-to-defeat-china 1/3Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen has advised the United States to bring money if they want
to beat China as he insisted that Bangladesh needs money for development.
He termed the just concluded visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to Brussels “very successful”
and said the European countries listened to Bangladesh and they would come up with funds.
His comment came as Bangladesh carried out massive development projects including the first-
ever underwater tunnel - Bangabandhu Tunnel in Chittagong- inaugurated on Saturday with
Chinese funds.
The US is critical to Bangladesh’s democracy and human rights situation.
Talking to reporters after an event at the Foreign Service Academy, the foreign minister said he
told the US that there would be “no benefit of scaring us”.
“We need money. So, bring money. You come only with advice. That (advice) cannot satisfy us. If
you want to defeat China, then you also come with a basket full of money like the Chinese and
tolerable proposals.”
The foreign minister also referred to the prime minister’s visit to Brussels to attend the Global
Gateway Summit which is dubbed as the Western version of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI).
During the visit, the democracy and human rights issues did not come in a big way. On the
contrary, the EU showed interest in investing in Bangladesh’s infrastructural development.
“The visit was very successful. They have listened to us. They are coming up with funds. They
will not give us only advice or scare us,” he said, adding that the European leaders highly
appreciated Bangladesh's leadership and development,” Dr Momen said. “This is a great
achievement for Bangladesh”. 
He said many countries want to sell their products while trying to put pressure in the name of
human rights and democracy.
“We said that we don’t want to be involved in war. We don’t want to purchase military equipment
now. Our priority is to ensure people's welfare,” he said.

Bangladesh's Chief Adviser, Professor Muhammad Yunus during his recent state visit to
China, met Chinese President Xi Jinping and both sides appear to have used this
opportunity to reaffirm old diplomatic and economic ties between the two countries.
During the meeting, Xi Jinping recalled China-Bangladesh long-standing history of friendly

maintains a high degree of stability and continuity in its good-neighbourly and friendly
policy toward Bangladesh, as this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of
China-Bangladesh diplomatic relations.
""China is ready to work with Bangladesh to bring China-Bangladesh cooperation to new
heights and deliver greater benefits to the two peoples, Xi said, stressing that China and
Bangladesh should continue to deepen mutual political trust and firmly support each other
on issues related to bilateral interests.
Analysts, in the context of the visit has pointed out some interesting areas of future
engagements between the two countries.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) from China in Bangladesh has risen to $2.67 billion as of
September 2024, according to official data, cementing China's position as the country's
second-largest investor. This FDI stock includes US Dollar 1.41 billion from mainland China
and $1.26 billion from Hong Kong, according to the Bangladesh Bank (BB), reflecting a
broader effort by Chinese firms to diversify amid the US-China trade war.
Bangladesh, with its low-cost labour and expanding industrial base, has emerged as an
attractive destination for Chinese companies seeking alternatives to traditional
manufacturing hubs.
The textile sector, a pillar of Bangladesh's export economy, has received the largest share of
Chinese FDI, totalling $760.14 million. The telecommunications sector has also drawn
substantial Chinese investment, with $322.45 million funneled into expanding 4G and 5G
networks.
Beyond these core industries, Chinese capital is flowing into agriculture, energy and
pharmaceuticals, strengthening Bangladesh's infrastructure and supply chains.
The trading sector alone has attracted $203.78 million, according to BB data, modernising
logistics and enhancing the country's global competitiveness.
Experts say these investments could increase further if Bangladesh creates a more
business-friendly environment, making it a prime beneficiary of shifting global trade
dynamics.
Political analysts assert that Yunus's visit to China has catapulted Bangladesh-China
relations to unprecedented heights, with Bangladesh securing a commitment of USD 2.1
billion in Chinese investments, loans, and grants during his historic China tour.25/05/2025, 14:16 Evolving partnership between Bangladesh and China | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/evolving-partnership-between-bangladesh-and-china 2/8Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen said nearly 30 Chinese companies have pledged to
invest $ 1 billion in Bangladesh.
China has also planned to lend some $ 400 million in the Mongla port modernisation
project, $350 million in the development of the China Industrial Economic Zone and
another $ 150 million as technical assistance. The rest of the amount would come as grants
and other forms of lending.
On March 27, Yunus addressed the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference in Hainan,
asking the Asian nations to chart a clear roadmap for a shared future and shared prosperity.
The Chief Adviser also focused on creating a sustainable financing mechanism for Asian
countries. ""We need reliable funds that address our challenges and meet our growing
demands.""
About trade cooperation, he said, Asia remains one of the least integrated regions and this
weak integration stifles investment and trade. ""We must work to boost trade cooperation
immediately,"" he said.
Referring to food and agriculture cooperation, Yunus said the Asian countries should
promote resource-efficient farming and domestic production must be enhanced for food
security. ""We need to reduce import reliance and achieve self-sufficiency. Expanding tech-
based sustainable agricultural solutions and innovation in regenerative and climate-smart
farming is key,"" he said.
It was also stressed by Bangladesh that building a strong tech ecosystem, sharing
knowledge and data and investing in technology incubation and innovation in Asia.
During meetings in China Professor Yunus also focused on the long-pending Rohingya
crisis, calling upon the Asian leaders to come forward towards ensuring safe and dignified
repatriation of displaced Rohingyas to Myanmar. It was pointed out that ""Bangladesh has
been hosting over 1.2 million Rohingyas, who are Myanmar nationals, for over seven years.
We continue to bear significant social, economic, and environmental costs,"" he said.
Analysts have also observed that there has been careful scrutiny pertaining to existing
trade benefits offered by China to Bangladesh. It has been noted that Bangladesh has
hardly been able to utilise the generous zero-duty trade benefits offered by China due to a
lack of product diversity, whereas Chinese imports have steadily risen, given the country's
increasing reliance on a single sourcing destination.
China has been the single largest trading partner for Bangladesh for many years, but
imports from the country have far outweighed exports, with shipments from Bangladesh25/05/2025, 14:16 Evolving partnership between Bangladesh and China | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/evolving-partnership-between-bangladesh-and-china 3/8failing to cross even the one-billion-dollar mark. Economists have indicated that in the
July-December period of the current fiscal year, Bangladesh imported goods worth $8.89
billion and exported goods worth $461.05 million, according to data from the Bangladesh
Bank (BB) and Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). In the previous fiscal, the total import value
from China was $16.63 billion whereas exports amounted to just $715.37 million.
Such a scenario, has for some time led business leaders, economists and geo-strategic
experts to suggest that Bangladesh should hold negotiations to attract more Chinese
investment in Bangladesh and minimise the trade gap.
Apparently, a major factor behind the rise in imports is the fact that Bangladesh relies
heavily on China for textile articles such as yarn and fabrics, especially man-made fibers
and fabrics, which account for over 40 per cent of total Chinese imports by Bangladesh.
Capital machinery also makes up nearly a quarter of imports, accounting for 24 per cent.
Other imports include cotton, food items and other materials.
On the other hand, Bangladesh's main export items to China are garments although China
itself is the largest apparel exporter in the world, boasting a global market share of over 31
per cent.
Efforts should also be made to try and allure Chinese entrepreneurs to relocate their
factories to Bangladesh as there are ample opportunities for investment, not only in man-
made fibers but also in sectors such as leather and leather goods, solar panels,
semiconductors and microchips, Razzaque added.
Currently, Chinese investment in Bangladesh is mainly confined to infrastructure projects It
has also consequently been suggested that there should be a regular joint trade and
investment fair to promote business between the two countries. Such a move would also
assist ongoing negotiations to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) between Bangladesh and
China and reframe it as a free trade and investment agreement (FTIA).
A lot of Chinese entrepreneurs have been inquiring about investing in Bangladesh after
Donald Trump came to power in the US and hiked duties on Chinese shipments to 35 per
cent. Moreover, Chinese importers are apparently also showing a lot of interest in importing
more jackfruits, mangoes, guavas and hilsa fish from Bangladesh, which would help
diversification.
The media has reported that the Chief Adviser's visit has also led an official of the Chinese
Entrepreneurs Association in Bangladesh (CEAB) to point out that this platform has more
than 1,000 registered members, with most companies investing in garments and textiles
enterprises in export processing zones.25/05/2025, 14:16 Evolving partnership between Bangladesh and China | The Financial Express

https://bdnews24.com/business/zv4b67jv3o 2/11The plan he announced in New Delhi is seen as Tokyo's bid to forge stronger ties with countries in South

Kishida also said Japan wanted Russia's invasion of Ukraine to end as soon as possible and called on the
""Global South"", a broad term referring to countries in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America, to ""show
solidarity"" after his talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Kishida said there were four ""pillars"" to Japan's new Indo-Pacific plan: maintaining peace, dealing with new
global issues in cooperation with Indo-Pacific countries, achieving global connectivity through various
platforms, and ensuring the safety of the open seas and skies.
Japan pledged $75 billion to the region by 2030 via private investment and yen loans and by ramping up
aid through of ficial governmental assistance and grants.
""We plan to expand the cooperation of the free and open Indo-Pacific framework,"" Kishida told the Indian
Council of W orld Affairs.25/05/2025, 11:37 Japan plans $75bn investment across Indo-Pacific to counter China
https://bdnews24.com/business/zv4b67jv3o 3/11He emphasised the increasing connectivity among countries and promoting freedom of navigation, with an
eye on increasing maritime defence and security among like-minded countries.
China has ramped up its military presence in the Indo-Pacific and rapidly modernised its navy while
promoting its Belt and Road Initiative.
“The kind of connectivity where you only rely on one country breeds political vulnerability ,” Kishida said.
“We aim to increase the number of options each country has so that they can overcome these
vulnerabilities and achieve further economic growth through connectivity ,” he added.25/05/2025, 11:37 Japan plans $75bn investment across Indo-Pacific to counter China

“We will conduct joint maritime exercises with India and the United States, as well as goodwill exercises
with ASEAN and the Pacific Islands,” Kishida said.
Japan, India, Australia and the United States are members of the so-called Quad grouping, created to
balance China’ s growing dominance. The four are will participate in the annual naval wargaming exercise

told reporters when asked why he chose New Delhi to announce his plan.
Modi said strengthening the India-Japan ""partnership is not only important for both our countries, it also
promotes peace, prosperity and stability in the Indo-Pacific region"".
The two have dif ferent stances on the war in Ukraine, however .
""We want to stop the invasion by Russia as soon as possible. In order for that to happen, it's important for
the international community , including the so-called Global South, to show solidarity ,"" Kishida said when
asked about his discussions with Modi.
Japan has imposed sanctions on Russia, as have many other nations.
India has not, and it has refused to blame Moscow for the conflict and has ramped up its buying of Russian
oil.
""Giving voice to the priorities of the Global South is an important pillar of our G20 presidency ,"" Modi said
after his talks with Kishida.

President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is up against a huge challenge in Myanmar  in
what Beijing had started considering as its backyard. Pro-democracy protestors there, who see China as
the main backer of the military junta that seized power on Feb 1, have started attacking Chinese
business interests as never before. The anti-Chinese violence is reminiscent of the one that swept
across Myanmar in 1967-68 when the Gen Ne Win-led military regime, resenting Chinese backing for a
communist insurrection, provoked public anger against Chinese business interests. Twenty years later ,
China regained the trust of the Burmese military Tatmadaw by backing its ruthless suppression of the
1988 uprising and ended up turning Myanmar into a satellite, or so it would have thought.
The first jolt to its ambitions came in 2008-09 when the Kachin tribesmen successfully opposed the $6
billion Myitsone Hydroelectric Dam Project, triggering a furious reaction by the Burmese civil society and
democratic parties. Aided by the global human rights and anti-big dam environmentalist groups, the
Burmese people finally forced the quasi-military regime of General Thein Sein to stop the China-funded
project. A decade later , despite intense lobbying, Beijing is nowhere near resumption of the mega
project.
But now Beijing, seen as the main backer of the military junta, is having had to bargain for something
much worse.
Pro-democracy protesters, mowed down by military machine guns on the streets of Myanmar's towns,
are turning to Chinese-financed factories and businesses, setting them on fire and even attacking
managers and workers. The protesters, who want the restoration of parliamentary democracy in the
country and a scaling down of the military's influence, feel attacking Chinese business interests will force
Beijing to coerce the Burmese military into backing down, handing back power to the elected lawmakersUpdated :  06 May 2021, 02:17 AM

upset with the Suu Kyi government because it not only refused to resume the Myitsone dam project but
also cut down the investment size of the Kyaukphyu deep-sea port project and drafted in other foreign
partners for the Yangon city mega project in July last year . Worse still, it declined to hand over the
monopoly of executing the project to the China Communication and Construction Company . This
Chinese firm has been accused of corruption in as many as 10 Asian and African countries where it is
undertaking infrastructure development projects.

Kyaukphyu-Y unnan oil-gas pipeline linking a China-financed deep-sea port on Myanmar's Rakhine coast
to its Yunnan province. If the military repression does not stop and if the peaceful protesters turn violent
leading to the emergence of armed urban insurgency in the Burmese heartland, terror attacks on key
China-funded infrastructure are a distinct possibility . That would seriously threaten the China-Myanmar
economic corridor , one of the two key BRI growth corridors with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ,
or CPEC, being the other one.
The CPEC is also under attack in the face of a surge of deadly attacks by Baloch separatists who resent
the exploitation of their mineral and hydrocarbon resources by Chinese companies who arm-twist the
Imran Khan government into granting huge concessions. Security risks and costs of the $60 billion
China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , or CPEC, are rising amid a resurgence of the deadly attacks by
separatists in the troubled Balochistan province. But the CPEC projects are also upsetting the Shias of
Gilgit-Baltistan where the CPEC starts.
Scores of China-funded huge infrastructure projects have been cancelled or are on hold in Indonesia,
Malaysia and the Philippines. Bangladesh has torpedoed the Chinese deep-sea port project at Sonadia
and awarded a similar project to Japan on its southern coast. In Sri Lanka, the long lease of the
Hambantota port to China after the government realised its inability to service the unsustainable debt
has created not only much angst against Beijing and its friends in the island nation, but also sent out a
global alarm on Chinese-funded projects, raising serious doubts about Beijing's motives in driving up the
project scale and then bargaining for outright long-term control over national assets – a ploy some
Western geo-strategists describe as the ""debt burden strategy for economic and political control"".

Bangladesh shouldn’t worry about debt
trap
Sat Jun 26, 2021 12:00 AM
Last update on: Sat Jun 26, 2021 12:34 AM
Says Chinese envoy
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming has said Bangladesh should never
worry about bad debt or the so-called debt trap.
Chinese Ambassador Li Jiming. Photo: Collected
""I would say that you've managed foreign debt very, very well, and there's no such
bad debt so far at all. You've earned a very, very high credit [recognition]
internationally in terms of [managing] international debts. So, never worry about
that,"" he said.
The envoy made the remarks while responding to a question at an online
symposium titled ""Bangladesh-China Relations: Prognosis for the Future"" hosted
by the Cosmos Foundation on Thursday evening.
The example of Sri Lanka came up in the context of a country that fell into a ""debt
trap"" as a result of public investment projects financed by China.
Ambassador Li, who delivered the keynote speech at the programme, however
said there was no proven evidence that China created any ""debt trap"" in any
country, including Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
""I think you've an excellent system and you've excellent officials and ministers to
take care of that. So, never worry about that,"" he said.
Referring to an article he read regarding Sri Lanka's debt situation, the Chinese
envoy said the total Chinese debt accounts for only less than 8 percent of the
whole debt of that country and of this 8 percent, much less is related to the Belt
and Road projects.
The ambassador also said there is government-to-government debt, which is
normally a soft, concessional loan with a very low interest late and very long
repayment period.
CPD Distinguished Fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya said China has emerged as a
big financial investor in Bangladesh involving major projects which have major
infrastructural implications.
Now there is a debated issue across the world whether this kind of a financial
flow is a ""debt trap"" for the countries like Bangladesh as it happened in Sri Lanka,
he said.
""Thankfully, Bangladesh's external debt remains moderately manageable and
most of the country's debts are from the multinational agencies and at this
moment it is not China.""
The economist, however, said they should be really mindful about the debt
repayment issue although they are in a comfortable position at this stage.
Bangladesh's total outstanding debt burden is well under 40 percent of its GDP. 
""But there are projections that this debt issue would be a challenging point for the
Bangladesh-China relationship beyond 2024,"" he added.
Ambassador Li said Bangladesh and China need to advance the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI). He said there is no doubt that closer cooperation under BRI will
strengthen strategic partnership of cooperation.
Bangladesh is the first South Asian country to sign up for BRI, which was first
proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013.
The Chinese envoy said China never took India as a ""strategic rival"", rather
considered India a good neighbour of the country.
He said the two countries are maintaining good relations for more than 2,000 to
3,000 years. ""Any Chinese intellectual, who is well-educated, would have a special
feeling. A good feeling, towards India -- that's something untold publicly
probably.""
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
Responding to a question about technology transfer, the ambassador said there
are more and more technology transfers happening between China and
Bangladesh.
He mentioned that a couple of years ago, China was not used to purchasing any
garment from Bangladesh. But these days, he said, a lot of readymade garment
products are being exported to China from Bangladesh.
The envoy said China and Bangladesh even can probably work together on space
technology in future.
TEESTA PROJECT
Asked about the Teesta river project, the ambassador said competent authorities
of Bangladesh did put up a proposal to China for the project,but the proposal was
too simple.
""I would say please make a more complete feasibility study report, and only after
that, we can start to assess it to make an evaluation,"" he added.
Cosmos Foundation Chairman Enayetullah Khan delivered the opening and
concluding remarks at the event, chaired by former adviser to the last caretaker
government Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury.

How Chinese media covered Hasina's
Beijing visit
Thu Jul 11, 2024 12:21 AM
Last update on: Thu Jul 11, 2024 12:27 AM
Bangladesh and China elevated their ties during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
visit to Beijing this week, according to the consensus in Chinese media outlets, a
preponderance of which happen to be state-owned.
The two countries today upgraded their relations to a ""comprehensive strategic
cooperative partnership"".
Photo: PID
China's state-led international broadcaster, CGTN, which broadcasts in English,
reported the upgrade with an emphasis on Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech
during the meeting.
Xi said since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1975, the two countries
have always shown mutual respect and support, treated each other on an equal
footing and engaged in win-win cooperation, according to CGTN.
He also said the relationship between China and Bangladesh stands as a shining
example of amicable interactions and mutually beneficial partnerships,
particularly among Global South nations.
Xi urged the two sides to make efforts for the Year of People-to-People Exchanges
between China and Bangladesh next year to promote exchanges and cooperation
in fields such as culture, tourism, media and sports, CGTN reported, adding that
he said China is ready to work closely with Bangladesh on international and
regional affairs, and strengthen coordination and cooperation within the United
Nations and other multilateral frameworks.
Global Times, the Chinese Communist Party's official mouthpiece, in a piece
titled ""China, Bangladesh elevate ties, broaden cooperation"" today, repeated most
of the CGTN report on Xi's speech, and carried the prime minister's assurances
that ""Bangladesh firmly adheres to the one-China principle, supports China's
stance on the Taiwan question, resolutely opposes external forces' interference in
China's internal affairs, and firmly supports China in safeguarding its core
interests"".
The report quoted Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National
Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, as saying that the visit by Hasina is a
link between the past and the future for bilateral relations, especially in
promoting high-level cooperation in the field of economy and trade.
The development strategies of the two countries will be further synergised, and
more economic and trade cooperation projects are expected to be implemented
in the future, injecting more substantive connotations into the duo's strategic
cooperative relations, Qian told Global Times.
Another expert that Global Times spoke to, Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow with
the Institute of International Relations at the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences, said the visit would further promote the traditional friendship between
the two countries.
The Global Times report also noted the Indian angle, reporting: ""[S]ome Indian
media outlets viewed Hasina's China visit as 'a balancing act to keep the two key
players happy,' as 'she needs India to be in power, and China for economic
support.' Some Indian media also talked down the cooperation between Beijing
and Dhaka.""
In this context, Hu told Global Times: ""India always uses various excuses to
obstruct and create hype whenever a South Asian leader visits China, but New
Delhi should not be overly concerned that other countries' engagement with
China will damage their relations with India.""
Meanwhile Qian, the other expert quoted in the report, said: ""For Bangladesh, in
the face of pressure from India, the development of China-Bangladesh relations
also provides a valuable choice for Dhaka to better safeguard its diplomatic
independence and development opportunities.""
Global Times also reported separately on ""The Summit on Trade, Business, and
Investment Opportunities between Bangladesh and China| that took place on
Tuesday, and on the day of the PM's arrival in Beijing, Monday, carried an op-ed
titled ""China-Bangladesh bonhomie benefits both"" by Zhang Xiaoyu, an expert in
South Asian Studies at the Communication University of China.
The South China Morning Post, one of the few privately-owned media outlets in
the country, based out of Hong Kong, titled its report ""China and Bangladesh
pledge to fight external interference and boost economic cooperation"" today.
It said Hasina reassured Xi over Taiwan, calling it ""Beijing's most sensitive issue"",
and quoted the prime minister as saying, ""Bangladesh firmly adheres to the one-
China principle, supports China's position on the Taiwan issue, and resolutely
opposes external forces interfering in China's internal affairs.""
China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted Wang Huning, a member of China's
Politburo Standing Committee who met with Hasina, as saying that ""China and
Bangladesh have respected and treated each other with equality, setting a good
example of friendly coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation between
countries.""",0.060012827,0.275953984,,Positive

Sino-Bangla relations and Bangladesh's Look East policy
Dr. Kazi Ihtesham and Mohammad Mahabubur Rahman
Bangladesh and China are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the
establishment of China-Bangladesh diplomatic relations. China has always
been an important factor in Bangladesh's foreign relations. In present
times, Bangladesh is adopting a Look East policy as an important
characteristic of its foreign policy . A core segment of that policy is Sino-
Bangla relations, considering China's present economic strength and
political influence. China may also be well aware of Bangladesh's geo-
political importance and market potentialities. Exchange of high profile
visits between Bangladesh and China shows both countries' seriousness to
strengthen Sino-Bangla bilateral relations.
Early stage
China was against Bangladesh's liberation war . In fact, up to August 1975,
there were no of ficial relations between the two countries. However , the
hidden cause lay in Bangladesh's relations with India and the former
USSR, India-USSR relations, Pakistan-China relations, and the China-
Pakistan-US axis.
At the time of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's regime in
Bangladesh, China exercised its veto power while Bangladesh was trying
to get UN membership. Though China did not agree to give formal
recognition to Bangladesh during Mujib's regime, it stopped opposing
Bangladesh's membership to the United Nations after a treaty signed
between Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India on April 28, 1974.
After the overthrow of the Mujib government, China of ficially recognised
Bangladesh on August 31, 1975. It of ficially established diplomatic
relations with Bangladesh on October 4, 1975. Since then, the bilateral
relations between the two countries have been growing very rapidly . At
the time, a tense relationship with India has caused Bangladesh to tilt
towards China. Starting from Ziaur Rahman's regime, all governments of
Bangladesh have contributed positively to strengthen Sino-Bangla
relations.
PM's China visit of 2002
The present BNP-led four party coalition government of Bangladesh has
adopted a Look East policy to explore and use the potentialities of eastern
countries for Bangladesh. By virtue of that, Bangladesh has emphasised
stronger Sino-Bangla relations. To open new dimensions of cooperation
between Bangladesh and China, the present prime minister of Bangladesh, 25/05/2025, 15:39 The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 5 Num 350
https://www.thedailystar.net/2005/05/23/d505231501126.htm 1/5Begum Khaleda Zia, visited China from December 23-27, 2002. It was
very significant for various reasons. The Bangladesh premier met with
almost all the main government of ficials and party leaders of China during
her visit. At the time, three treaties and an MoU were signed on military
cooperation, economy , and technology between the two countries. China
promised to give additional 1 10 million yuan (Chinese currency) with
previously sanctioned 50 million yuan interest free loan for building the
6th Bangladesh-China friendship bridge on the Dholessori river . Of this,
60 million is grant and the rest is interest-free loan. It is very encouraging
that five bridges exist in Bangladesh as a symbol of Bangladesh-China
friendship. In addition, China declared $24 million as grants for
Bangladesh which it previously gave as interest-free loan to build an
international conference centre at Dhaka. Now the centre is treated as a
gift of the Chinese government. A treaty has been signed to establish
Bangladesh-China joint venture ceramic and tannery industries. China will
also provide support for Bangladesh's agriculture and tourism sectors.
During Khaleda's visit to China, some initiatives were taken to reduce the
trade deficit which is in favour of China. In 2002, Bangladesh's import
trade with China was worth $64.2 million, while the export trade was
worth $19 million. Now the deficit is over $500 million. During Khaleda's
visit, Bangladesh requested China to allow duty-free entry of 34
Bangladeshi items to China as a part of the Bangkok accord.
Moreover , official talks were held between the two sides on sub-regional
cooperation. The proposed cooperation includes regions like Yunnan
province of China, Bangladesh, Myanmar , Laos, Vietnam, and the North-
Eastern states of India. Asian Highway may be a regulator for this
economic and commercial exchange. The initiative is termed as the
""Kunming Initiative"" because Kunming of Yunnan province is the centre
point of the Chinese proposal. Kunming-Dhaka direct air flight is a part of
the proposed initiative. A meeting was held on this initiative on February
6-7, 2002, and China, India, Myanmar , and Bangladesh were the
participants. China wants to make a common economic grid circling
Myanmar , Thailand, and the Eastern states of India using its Yunnan
province.
Bangladesh expressed its support to ""One China Policy"" of China during
Khaleda's visit. At that time an agreement on defense cooperation was
signed between the two countries which was termed as ""Umbrella
Agreement"" by foreign minister of Bangladesh M. Morshed Khan. China
is the supplier of most of the military equipment of Bangladesh. From the
very beginning of its diplomatic relations with Bangladesh, China
provides significant support for Bangladesh's military . Higher training for
Bangladesh army and arms supply are among the support. But there were
no agreements on defense cooperation. The signed treaty is a
strengthening ef fort compared to the previous MoUs signed for defense
cooperation. This is not a defense and security agreement. But
undoubtedly it is significant for a small state like Bangladesh.
Wen Jiabao's Bangladesh visit of 2005
Chinese premier Wen Jiabao was in Bangladesh on an of ficial visit on
April 7-8, 2005. After a summit with the Bangladesh side, led by the PM,
and attended by other important ministers and of ficials, nine accords --
five agreements, two MoUs, a contract and an exchange of letter -- were25/05/2025, 15:39 The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 5 Num 350
https://www.thedailystar.net/2005/05/23/d505231501126.htm 2/5signed. The Chinese premier readily agreed to constructing the Di-
Aluminium Phosphate (DAP) fertilizer factory in Chittagong entirely on
concessional lending instead of on supplier's credit. Both sides agreed to
make preferential duty arrangements to boost the import and export of
commodities between the two countries. China recognised the imbalance
in trade with Bangladesh, and pledged to take active steps to increase
imports from Bangladesh. The Chinese premier even said that his
government would give subsidy to Chinese business people to increase the
import of Bangladeshi goods under a package of measures. Under a signed
accord, China will give $6 million to Bangladesh for capacity building of
civil servants. Moreover , the Chinese side also agreed to increase
scholarships for Bangladeshi students. China will also help Bangladesh
make peaceful use of nuclear ener gy. Foreign Minister M. Morshed Khan
said Bangladesh will go for peaceful use of nuclear ener gy in power
generation, medicine, and other development purposes under an
agreement just signed with China. Both countries signed the Bangladesh-
China Cooperation Agreement on Peaceful Usage of Nuclear Ener gy. To
make Bangladesh's position clear to all, Hemayetuddin, the foreign
secretary of Bangladesh, said: ""There is nothing military or related to
weapons in this agreement."" China will also cooperate in the development
of the tourism sector of Bangladesh and will make Bangladesh an
approved tourist destination for Chinese citizens. Both the countries
agreed to the opening of direct air link between Beijing and Dhaka via
Kunming. During Wen Jiabao's visit, Bangladesh again expressed its
support for the One-China policy .
Chinese potentialities and cooperation possibilities
China's rise as an economic power and its potentialitiesmake it a leader in
the developing world. From 1979 to 1997, China's average annual growth
rate was 9.8 percent, 6.5 percentage points higher than that of the rest of
the world. After the September 1 1 terrorist attacks in the US, the world
was suf fering from an economic depression. Even at that time China was
able to maintain a considerable economic growth. Up to 2001, China's
position was the sixth in the world, according to the average production.
Among the developing countries, this position was second. If it grows in
this way it will be the greatest economic power in terms of purchasing
capacity by 2020. Strong economic and commercial relations with such a
potential superpower will eventually help Bangladesh strengthen its own
economy . Moreover , the positive thing is that the Chinese side is also
interested to develop close ties with Bangladesh. China has a great market
interest in Bangladesh. However , China's strategic interest in Bangladesh
is magnified with market potentials. Other than commodity trade, China is
also involved in infrastructural development of Bangladesh. It is providing
support for manufacturing, mining, fertilizer factories, building roads and
bridges, etc.
China has expertise in sectors like telecommunication, information
technology , textile and RMG, foodstuf f, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals
which may be useful for Bangladesh in terms of cost ef fectiveness through
joint cooperation and investment. But Bangladesh should be careful for its
own RMG sector . Because in a quota-free world, China is one of the
competitors of Bangladesh. But there is also a chance for cooperation.
Now Bangladesh imports a good quantity of fabrics for its RMG sectors
from India. As China has suf ficient expertise in producing fabrics,25/05/2025, 15:39 The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 5 Num 350
https://www.thedailystar.net/2005/05/23/d505231501126.htm 3/5Bangladesh should encourage Chinese investment in Bangladesh in this
sector . Joint investment in this sector may also meet Bangladesh's needs. It
will be profitable for both countries. For Bangladesh, this kind of
cooperation may help to secure its market competency in the age of
globalisation.
Bangladesh is a potential country for tourism. Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar
which is an attractive tourist spot and famous for the world's longest sea
beach is very near to Yunnan province of China. One can easily reach
Dhaka from Kunming of Yunnan province of China within one and a half
hours by air . Both the countries have agreed to start direct air link between
Dhaka and Kunming in the shortest possible time. During the Chinese
premiere Wen Jiabao's Bangladesh visit, a good move was made for
Bangladesh's tourism sector , making Bangladesh a tourist destination for
Chinese citizens. So after staring the Dhaka-Kunming direct air link a new
dimension of tourism will open for both the countries. Not only will the
Chinese get an opportunity to visit tourist spots of Bangladesh like Cox's
Bazar sea beach, Chittagong Hill Tracts, Potenga sea beach, etc., but also
the Bangladeshis will get the privilege to visit the land of ""eternal spring""
and also see mountains and glaciers and ancient forests in Yunnan and
Sichuan provinces of China. Moreover , if the two countries can build
Kunming-Chittagong road link, it will definitely help to boost trade and
tourism for both.
However , it may be fruitful for Bangladesh if it can make a Bangladesh-
Myanmar -China tri-nation economic grid. Like Bangladesh, Myanmar
also has a strong relation with China. And from past few years
Bangladesh-Myanmar economic relation is increasing significantly . So a
tri-nation economic cooperation is possible.
Conclusion
In the age of globalisation, economic diplomacy may be the key tool for
almost every country's foreign policy . All countries are tilting towards
bilateral and multilateral economic cooperation and economic pacts.
Regional or ganisations are working as a useful tool for or ganising
cooperation among the regional countries. Unfortunately , in South Asia,
Saarc is not working properly due to some internal problems of its
member states. Saarc's failure may be a reason behind adopting
Bangladesh's Look East policy .
Another reason is to reduce dependency on India. As a neighbour ,
Bangladesh has had some bad experiences with India's hegemonic attitude
on various bilateral issues like border problems, water sharing problems,
etc. Moreover , India does not seem serious about reducing its trade
imbalance with Bangladesh. The bilateral trade deficit has now exceeded
over $1 billion. China may be a good option for Bangladesh to reduce
dependency on India, and it seems more serious than India about reducing
our bilateral trade deficit.
However , Bangladesh should always be watchful of Sino-Indo relations.
Recently China and India have been inching towards cooperation and have
signed an accord setting out ""guiding principles"" to resolve their border
disputes. They have also agreed on economic cooperation. Reviewing the
trend and transformation of regional politics, Bangladesh should follow a
balanced foreign policy . It cannot af ford to displace one to make the other25/05/2025, 15:39 The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 5 Num 350

relations with India as well.

Balancing ties with China and India

 For all latest news, follow The Financial Express Google News channel.
In the previous article (Part I), we have discussed how Bangladeshʼs emerging economic
relationship with China can lead to new developments in its bilateral negotiations with
India, which are required for resolving some of the crucial issues like Ganges and Teesta
water-sharing disputes, trade imbalances, and economic dependency. We emphasized how
Chinaʼs expanding influence in South Asia, particularly through its Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI), presents Bangladesh with unique opportunities to strengthen its bargaining power
with India. By diversifying its economic ties, attracting Chinese investments, and enhancing
water resource management through Chinese-backed infrastructure projects, Bangladesh
can push India toward more cooperative and equitable agreements.
Building on these strategic insights, Part II explores in greater detail how Bangladeshʼs
defense, security, infrastructure, and diplomatic partnerships with China might continue to
reshape Indiaʼs engagement of the region. We discuss how security cooperation with China
might encourage India to upgrade its military relations with Bangladesh toward more
regional stability and robust bilateral dialogues. We also examine how Bangladeshʼs
increasing infrastructure development under Chinaʼs BRI might force India to accelerate its
cross-border connectivity projects in order to maintain regional competitiveness.
Finally, we discuss how Bangladeshʼs improved diplomatic standing in key regional
organizations such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and the
Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) Economic Corridor can strengthen its influence
on India regarding unresolved issues like trade agreements, transit arrangements, and
water-sharing negotiations. As former U.S. As the Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wisely
said, “In crises, the most daring decision is often the safest.” By using its strategic
relationship with China, Bangladesh can turn the tables and change its regional position so
that India will have to approach bilateral negotiations with greater urgency, flexibility, and
mutual respect.
This second part comprehensively analyzes how Bangladesh can convert its geo-economic
vulnerabilities into strategic assets by balancing its relations with both regional giants. ABN
25/05/2025, 11:14 Balancing ties with China and India | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/balancing-ties-with-china-and-india 1/6well-calibrated foreign policy driven by national interest may transform Bangladesh from a
passive regional player to an assertive diplomatic force capable of shaping the geopolitical
landscape of South Asia.
Security and Defense Balance: Chinaʼs expanding role as a defense supplier to Bangladesh
has fundamentally altered the regional security dynamics of South Asia. By supplying
submarines, naval vessels, missile systems, and advanced military technologies, China has
positioned itself as a critical defense partner for Bangladesh. India views this growing
military cooperation with unease, realizing that its traditional strategic dominance in the
region is under threat.
Security Dialogues and Cooperation. Bangladeshʼs growing defense relationship with China
may influence India to seek deeper security arrangements with Dhaka. India may further
strengthen maritime security cooperation, counterterrorism operations, and intelligence-
sharing mechanisms to retain its leverage in Bangladeshʼs security calculus.
This may be done by expanding the scope of bilateral security dialogues on: (a) Maritime
Stability: Joint naval exercises and coordinated patrols in the Bay of Bengal to counter
Chinaʼs growing naval presence. (b) Counterterrorism and Border Management: Expanding
cross-border security protocols to combat smuggling, trafficking, and insurgency-related
threats. (c) Defense Technology and Training: Increasing military training programs and
defense technology transfers to Bangladeshʼs armed forces.
As aptly noted by former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, “The only thing we have to
fear is fear itself.” Proactive security cooperation with Bangladesh would reduce Indiaʼs
anxiety over Chinaʼs strategic military foothold in South Asia.
Broader Regional Security and Strategic Stability. A greater regional framework involving
Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar on security issues in order to balance Chinaʼs
fast-developing defense relations in the Bay of Bengal would not be out of place either. The
cooperation in disaster management, peacekeeping operations, and maritime security,
meanwhile, will further reinforce the regional stability against Chinaʼs strategic depth in
South Asia.
As former Indian National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon once said, “Regional
cooperation in security is not a luxury but a necessity for maintaining peace and
development in South Asia.” Indiaʼs recalibrated security policy toward Bangladesh could
exemplify this philosophy.
Negotiation on Infrastructure and Connectivity: The BRI has shaped Bangladeshʼs
infrastructure landscape, wherein projects such as the Payra Deep-Sea Port, Karnaphuli
Tunnel, and Padma Bridge have enhanced economic connectivity. India needs to fast-track
its cross-border transit agreements and connectivity projects so that China does not
monopolize critical infrastructure development in Bangladesh.
Strengthening Transit and Connectivity Arrangements
India could fast-track key infrastructure projects such as: (a) India-Bangladesh Coastal
Shipping Agreement: developing sea-borne trade through ports at Chattogram and Mongla,
among others. (b) Expanding cargo routes through Indian northeastern states via the so-
called BBIN corridor for transshipment. (c) Reinforcing cross-border rail lines, such as the
Agartala-Akhaura and Kolkata-Chattogram routes.
By developing connectivity projects, India can decrease the dependence of Bangladesh on
China-funded infrastructure, thus ensuring far greater regional integration.
Strategic Impact on Regional Trade. Improved transit arrangements would place
Bangladesh as a strategic trade hub, connecting South Asia and Southeast Asia. More
regional trade corridors would also lead to the diversification of Bangladeshʼs economic
partners and greater economic independence from China.
As former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh aptly said, “Connectivity is the lifeline of
the economy in the modern world.” In chasing mutual infrastructure objectives,25/05/2025, 11:14 Balancing ties with China and India | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/balancing-ties-with-china-and-india 2/6Bangladesh and India could achieve higher efficiency in trade and greater regional
integration.
Diplomatic Maneuvering in Regional Organizations. Bangladeshʼs improved relations with
China have given the country a higher status in powerful regional platforms such as BRICS,
the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar
(BCIM) Economic Corridor. This increased diplomatic profile provides substantial strategic
leverage vis-à-vis India.
Enhancement of Bangladeshʼs Strategic Leverage
Chinaʼs international reach in multilateral organizations provides yet another platform to
Bangladesh for putting pressure on India on critical issues relating to water-sharing and
trade integration. China, an important player in water management and economic projects,
is likely to convince India through its involvement towards a more cooperative attitude.
Strategic Influence on Bilateral Engagements. It might push India to offer better trade,
water-sharing, and investment deals as a counterbalance to the fast-expanding role of
China in Bangladeshʼs strategic affairs: faster resolution of the long-stalled Teesta Water
Treaty, reduced trade tariffs, and more development aid packages.
As former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wisely said, “In crises, the most daring
decision is often the safest.” The more Bangladesh could establish its strategic worth
through Sino-Bangladeshi cooperation, the better the deals it could negotiate with India.
Conclusion: A Strategic Balancing Act for Bangladesh: Bangladeshʼs deepening ties with
China present a critical opportunity to reshape its regional diplomacy by balancing Indiaʼs
dominance while advancing its national development goals. Strengthening its economic
partnership, expanding military cooperation, and securing diplomatic support from China
can help Bangladesh address long-standing bilateral challenges with India—particularly in
water-sharing agreements, trade negotiations, security dialogues, and cross-border
infrastructure projects.
All of that, however, requires tremendous skill in diplomacy, political foresight, and
strategic patience. This art of balance between China and India is a delicate balance for
Bangladesh, in which neither should be given disproportionate influence while fostering
cooperation where there is a benefit to her national interests. As once famously said by
Singaporeʼs founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, “In the end, geopolitics is about balance
of power. You align where your interests lie.”
By leveraging Chinaʼs strategic investments while enjoying constructive relations with India,
Bangladesh has an opportunity to evolve from a regional underdog into a significant
powerbroker in South Asia. How well the country negotiates concessions, secures fair
treaties, and further strengthens its economy depends on this tightrope walk. As former
U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger aptly said, “In crises, the most daring decision is
often the safest.”
Bangladesh now stands on the threshold of redefining its geopolitical future-turning
geographic vulnerabilities into strategic assets under a robust foreign policy framework. It
is capable of transforming regional challenges into platforms for lasting stability,
prosperity, and global recognition with prudent, visionary leadership and a well-defined
national vision. As the Chinese proverb goes: “When the wind of change blows, some build
walls, others build windmills.”
It is time for Bangladesh to build its windmills, harnessing the changing geopolitical winds
to secure a brighter, more resilient future.

'China-Bangladesh relations have
become the model of friendship between
countries with different social systems
and different cultures'
Thu Jul 19, 2012 12:00 AM
Last update on: Thu Jul 19, 2012 12:00 AM
His Excellency Li Jun
China's new ambassador to Bangladesh, Li Jun, arrived in Dhaka on February
18 and presented his credentials to the President on March 6. In an exclusive
interview with The Daily Star's Diplomatic Correspondent Rezaul Karim
recently, he talked on a wide range of bilateral issues. He said he would try his
best and cooperate with the government and people of Bangladesh to improve
further the ties between the two countries. He also said China and Bangladesh
are good neighbours. Since 1975, the bilateral relationship has always been
developing in a smooth manner an d bilateral cooperation in various areas has
been deepened. Following are excerpts from the interview.
The Daily Star (TDS): As the new Chinese Ambassador in Bangladesh, what are
the priorities you plan to emphasise during your assignment in this country?
Li Jun (L J): In March and June 2010, H.E. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of
Bangladesh, and H.E. Xi Jinping, Vice President of China, had a successful
exchange of visits. The two sides issued a Joint Statement and decided to establish
and develop a ""Closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation"" between China
and Bangladesh from the strategic perspective and on the basis of the principles
of longstanding friendship, equality and mutual benefit. I believe this set the
direction of and provided the guidelines for the development of our bilateral
relationship.
During my tenure,
* I will do my utmost to consolidate and develop the bilateral relationship with
the aim of promoting the development of our two countries and the welfare of
our two peoples;
* I will continue to push for more exchanges of high-level visits and contacts and
friendly exchanges between government agencies, parliaments, political parties,
and non-governmental organisations of our two countries;
* I will continue to push for intensified cooperation in trade, investment,
agriculture, transportation and infrastructure development on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit;
* I will continue to push for a further widening of people-to-people and cultural
exchanges and cooperation with a view to promoting mutual understanding and
friendship between the two peoples;
* I will continue to push for strengthened exchanges and cooperation between
the militaries and law enforcement departments to safeguard respective national
security and stability and promote peace and stability in the region;
* I will continue to push for closer coordination and cooperation to uphold the
common interests of the two countries as well as that of the developing countries
in international and regional affairs, such as climate change, energy and food
security.
I am confident that with the joint efforts of our two countries, the closer
comprehensive partnership of cooperation between China and Bangladesh will
be brought to a new high and bring tangible benefits for our two peoples.
TDS: Bangladesh and China enjoy excellent bilateral relations. How do you
foresee these relations developing further in the days ahead?
L J: The traditional friendship between our two peoples date back to over two
thousand years ago. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1975,
China-Bangladesh ties have been developing in a smooth manner and the
pragmatic cooperation in various fields has been further strengthened. It was the
efforts that successive governments and the peoples of our two countries have
made that contributed to the enhancement of China-Bangladesh friendship. To
them I pay my tributes.
Currently, the development of relations between China and Bangladesh enjoys the
right time, right place, and right people. China is implementing the 12th Five Year
Plan with scientific development as guidance and transforming economic growth
pattern as the main objective. At the same time, Bangladesh is pushing forward
the ""Digital Bangladesh"" and ""Vision 2012."" Our development strategies have
provided us great scope for cooperation. China and Bangladesh are close
neighbours, the region where we are situated has been experiencing rapid
growth, which created more opportunities for regional and international
cooperation. Apart from that, our bilateral relationship has neither problems left
from history, nor conflicts of interest at present. Compassion, understanding,
support, and mutual-assistance have always been the main theme of our
relationship.
I am convinced that the traditional friendship between China Bangladesh and
mutually beneficial cooperation will better contribute to the development of the
two countries and benefit the two peoples.
TDS: What are the major follow-up events after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
visit to China in March 2010?
L J: In March and June 2010, H.E. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh
and H.E. Xi Jinping, Vice President of China had an exchange of visits to each
other's countries. The two sides decided to establish a ""Closer Comprehensive
Partnership of Cooperation"" from the strategic perspective and on the basis of the
principles of longstanding friendship, equality, and mutual benefit. A Joint
Statement was also issued which reflected the consensus reached by leaders of
both countries to further consolidate and develop China-Bangladesh relationship.
Since then, there have been positive developments in bilateral relationship. There
have been constant exchanges of high-level visits between the two countries. The
Speaker of Bangladesh Parliament Abdul Hamid and Foreign Minister Dipu Moni,
as well as many ministers, have visited China. Liu Qi, Member of Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China (CPC) and Secretary of
CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, Qin Guangrong, Governor of Yunnan Province
of China as well as other high level officials visited Bangladesh.
There has been much progress in bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
Bilateral trade volume in 2011 reached $8.26 billion, with an increase of 17%
compared with 2010. Bangladeshi export to China reached $449 million, an
increase of 67.5%. According to local news reports, Chinese investment in
Bangladesh in 2011 amounted to over $200 million. The agreements on
introduction of 3G technology and expansion of 2.5G network, and on Shajhalal
fertilizer factory project were signed. The construction work will start very soon.
China also exempted debts of Bangladesh worth more than 600 million RMB.
There also have been positive developments in bilateral cultural exchanges. In
November 2011, Beijing Night Art Performance and Charming Beijing Photo
Exhibition were successfully held in Dhaka. Fantastic performances of the
Chinese artists and beautiful pictures of Beijing deepened Bangladeshi people's
understanding towards China. ""Happy Chinese New Year"" cultural events have
become a fam ous Chinese cultural brand in Bangladesh. Every year, Dhaka
citizens flock to the theater to enjoy the exciting moments of traditional Chinese
New Year.
In addition, there has been big progress also in other areas such as agriculture,
education, military, etc. I will continue to push forward the all-dimensional
cooperation in various fields between our two countries.
TDS: During the PM's visit to Beijing, Bangladesh and China agreed to
strengthen cooperation in the military and law enforcement areas at various
levels. Is there any progress in those fiends?
L J: Military cooperation is an important part of the all-dimensional cooperation
between China and Bangladesh. In the Joint Statement issued during Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to China in March 2010, the two sides agreed to
strengthen exchanges and cooperation between the militaries and law
enforcement departments to safeguard respective national security and stability
and promote peace and stability in the region. Military cooperation between
China and Bangladesh strictly adheres to relevant international law and norms on
international relations, and is not against any third party. In 2011, there was
successful cooperation between the two countries in this regard. Air Chief
Marshal Ma Xiaotian, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of People's Liberation
Army and Vice Admiral Ding Yiping, Deputy Commander of Navy of People's
Liberation Army visited Bangladesh with big success. General Mubin, Chief of
Army Staff of Bangladesh paid a visit to China, which was fruitful. I believe this
tendency of friendly cooperation will be maintained and further developed.
TDS: How do you evaluate China-Bangladesh relations under the present
Awami League-led grand alliance government in comparison to ties under
previous governments?
L J: The friendship between China and Bangladesh is a genuine and time-tested
one. No matter which party is in power, this bilateral relationship maintains the
tendency of moving forward. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in
1975, successive governments of Bangladesh have been making important
contributions to the development of the bilateral relationship. China-Bangladesh
relations have become the model of friendship between countries with different
social systems and different cultures.
During the tenure of current government under the leadership of H.E. Sheikh
Hasina, China-Bangladesh relations have witnessed considerable development,
and the all-dimensional cooperation between the two countries has been
continuously strengthened. Presently, China-Bangladesh relations are standing at
a new starting point, facing unprecedented historic opportunities. The Chinese
side stands ready to closely work with the Bangladesh side to further enrich the
closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation, strengthen the existing
bilateral cooperation in different fields, and enhance the friendship between the
two peoples.
TDS: Strategically, how does China see Bangladesh in the geo-political equation
in the region?
L J: China adheres to the foreign policy of ""building friendship and partnership
with the neighboring countries,"" and would like to establish and maintain good-
neighbourly relations with all its neighbouring countries. China attaches
importance to the important role of Bangladesh in maintaining peace, stability
and development of South Asia. China is willing to join hands with Bangladesh
and further promote the closer Comprehensive Cooperative Partnership between
the two countries.
TDS: The cabinet recently approved the draft of Sonadia Deep Seaport
Authority Act. Is there any development from the Chinese side about
construction of the deep seaport at Sonadia in Chittagong?
L J: The deep seaport in Sonadia Island is of strategic importance to Bangladesh
and will be helpful in enabling Bangladesh to become the regional transportation
and logistics centre. Chinese enterprises have advanced technologies,
equipments and ample funds. Over the years, China Harbour Engineering
Company Ltd has accumulated rich experience in this regard. Presently, this
company has established an office in Dhaka and stands ready to participate in
this project in a commercial manner. Chinese enterprises are also ready to
cooperate with enterprises from other countries to jointly take part in this
project. So long as the Bangladeshi side shows enough will and determination,
this project can make positive progress very soon.
TDS: How can China cooperate with Bangladesh in tackling the impact of
climate change in Bangladesh?
L J: As a country most vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh has been
experiencing sufferings caused by climate change. China fully understands and
respects the concerns of Bangladesh over it. During international negotiations on
climate change, China has always been supporting the legitimate and reasonable
requests of Bangladesh and the Least Developed Countries as a whole. As
developing countries, China and Bangladesh should stick to the principle of
""common but differentiated responsibilities"" and work together to safeguard the
common interests of developing countries.
China and Bangladesh are both victims of climate change. On this issue, the two
countries face the same challenges and our basic interests are the same. Over the
years, China has already carried out cooperation with Bangladesh in the area of
adaptation. For example, China helped Bangladesh in projects of river dredging.
The Chinese Government provided relevant training for Bangladeshi officials and
technicians. China will continue to strengthen the cooperation with Bangladesh
in this regard on the basis of ""equal consultation, mutual benefit and common
development"". China will continue to support the capacity building to help
Bangladesh better resist the adverse effects of climate change. Relevant
government institutions of the two countries can have detailed discussions.
TDS: Is there any progress in the construction of the 8th Friendship Bridge (2nd
Meghna Bridge) and Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Centre?
L J: Consultations are going on between our two countries concerning the 8th
Friendship Bridge. I believe there will be a positive result soon. As for the China-
Bangladesh Friendship Exhibition Centre, we noticed some news reports saying
that the Bangladeshi government has decided to build this Centre at Purbachal.
We would be very happy to get the confirmation from and work with the
Bangladeshi side so that concrete progress can be made concerning this project.
TDS: Would you be willing to provide assistance to Bangladesh in launching a
communication and remote sensing satellite into orbit in the near future?
L J: China is willing to provide assistance to Bangladesh in launching a satellite.
This has been reflected in the Joint Statement issued by the two countries during
the visit of Her Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to China in March
2010. The two sides can have further consultations in this regard.
TDS: Will you provide assistance for the dredging of riverbeds and for capacity
building through training of personnel?
L J: Bangladesh is a country with a large number of rivers. River dredging is
essential to the livelihood of Bangladesh people and the development of this
country. Against the backdrop of global climate change, river dredging becomes
even more important. China understands the need of Bangladesh and always tries
to extend its help. Each year, the Chinese government provides relevant training
courses for Bangladeshi government official and technicians. Besides, the
Chinese government strongly supports qualified Chinese enterprises to take part
in dredging projects. In September 2011, China Harbour Engineering Company
Ltd was selected to implement a project for Jamuna River dredging (14
kilometers). China will continue to provide its support at the request of
Bangladeshi government.",0.143263289,0.387477861,,Positive

x25/05/2025, 15:59 Bangladesh's growing importance to China: A reflection
https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/348341/bangladesh-s-growing-importance-to-china-a 1/4Bangladesh and China's relationship has attracted a lot of attention lately as it shows a dynamic
and changing cooperation going beyond simple infrastructure support. Very recently, as a part of
a think-tank team invited by the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka, I got the rare chance to visit China
with university professors, retired government officials, representatives of civil society, and
research groups. This trip gave me a great understanding of the subtleties of the bilateral relations
between Bangladesh and China as well as the mutual goals and objectives behind this
cooperation.
During our trip, we spoke with senior officials of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well
as several think-tank organizations on a range of concerns relevant to our bilateral ties. The
Chinese government's plan to deepen its ties with Bangladesh beyond the parameters of the Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI) was among the most startling disclosures. Although BRI has been very
helpful in promoting infrastructural development in Bangladesh, the Chinese want closer, more
complex relationships across political, cultural, and economic spheres. 
Approaching the 50th anniversary of the Bangladesh-China friendship, scheduled for 2025, this
year represents a major turning point. This approaching jubilee provides a contemplative time to
assess development and plot future directions of cooperation. The exchanges during our tour
highlighted the Chinese excitement to honour this historic country with more collaboration and
mutual development. 
As declared by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of Bangladesh, the fundamental
principle of Bangladesh’s foreign policy is ""friendliness to all, malice to none."" Bangladesh's
diplomatic relations -- including its interaction with China -- have been greatly shaped by this
principle. 
Bangladesh has been able to ensure a solid balance while maintaining its relationship with
different countries. The Chinese counterpart underlined Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
importance not just in guiding Bangladesh's development path but also in her powerful presence
on the international scene. Her leadership has been crucial in helping Bangladesh to project a
progressive and optimistic image that appeals strongly inside Chinese diplomatic and strategic
circles.
There were no official responsibilities on our delegation's trip to China, which permitted real and
honest communication of ideas and viewpoints. The Chinese Embassy separately invited every

them on different issues relating to bilateral relations. This autonomy encouraged open
communication, which helped us to grasp the Chinese points of view and aspirations about their
interaction with Bangladesh.
One thing that stayed with me was the unmatched friendliness of our Chinese counterparts. The
kindness and friendliness we encountered matched the great hospitality of the Bengali people,
therefore highlighting a shared cultural thread among Asian cultures. Deeper people-to-people
relationships are firmly rooted in the camaraderie and mutual respect this shared cultural ethos of
hospitality develops. 

China's desire to strengthen its connection with Bangladesh also reflects
its lar ger plan to keep and increase its impact in South Asia
The Chinese desire for closer bilateral relations with Bangladesh is several-sided. Economically,
China sees Bangladesh as a key friend in South Asia because of its strategic location that
provides major geopolitical advantages. Under the BRI, ports, infrastructure, and industrial zones
have grown to constitute evidence of this strategic aim. The Chinese are eager to diversify this
connection, though, to include more trade, cross-cultural interactions, and educational
cooperation.
Regarding education, academic cooperation between Chinese and Bangladeshi institutions is
attracting growing attention. Such programs can open the path for faculties and student
interactions, cooperative research collaborations, and knowledge and experience sharing. These
educational connections not only enhance the intellectual scene of both nations but also help the
younger generations to develop goodwill and understanding between them. 
Culturally, cooperation has great possibilities. Both countries have rich cultural legacies and
customs that should be honoured by cooperative events, celebrations, and exhibits. By acting as a
link, these cross-cultural interactions help to bring the people of both nations closer and foster
greater respect for their customs and history. 
China recognizes, strategically, Bangladesh's contribution to regional stability and growth.
Bangladesh's balanced approach to foreign policy, together with its economic development and
expansion, help it to be a major participant in the complicated geopolitical scene of South Asia.

Kazi Anis Ahmed, PublisherChina's desire to strengthen its connection with Bangladesh also reflects its larger plan to keep
and increase its impact in South Asia. 
During our tour, the conversations also covered the need for sustainable growth. Both nations
understand the difficulties presented by climate change as well as the importance of group efforts
in sustainable practices and environmental protection. China's developments in renewable energy
and green technologies might provide Bangladesh's sustainability projects great inspiration and
assistance. 
We should build on the current basis and investigate fresh directions of collaboration as we
approach the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh-China ties. The Chinese people's enthusiasm to
strengthen their relations with Bangladesh is a good indication of their dedication to cooperation
that benefits not only both countries but also helps to maintain regional peace and development.
All things considered, the trip to China was eye-opening and made clear how much Bangladesh is
becoming of significance to China. It strengthened the idea that bilateral interactions based on
mutual respect, common interests, and a dedication to cooperative development are most likely to
be beneficial. Looking forward to the 50th anniversary of our alliance, Bangladesh and China
have a clear road ahead for a voyage of continuous, multifarious collaboration and a fresh feeling
of hope.

China-Bangladesh cooperation will bear
golden fruits
Fri Oct 14, 2016 12:00 AM
Last update on: Fri Oct 14, 2016 03:23 AM
H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China
At the kind invitation of President Abdul Hamid, I will pay a state visit to the
beautiful country of Bangladesh in this golden harvest season of autumn. It has
been six years since my last trip to this country and I look forward to meeting
friends both old and new and discussing with them how China and Bangladesh
can work together for common development.
Bangladesh is a fascinating and promising land. It is where the Padma, Jamuna
and Meghna rivers flow into the sea. Its vast expanse of fertile fields which
normally have the color of emerald green become a sea of golden yellow at the
time of harvest. Endowed with rich natural resources, this land is home to a hard-
working and talented nation and a time-honored and splendid culture. In fact,
fam ous poet Rabindranath Tagore wrote many of his most notable works in
Bengali.
Bangladesh is a land filled with hope. Since its independence, Bangladesh has
come a long way. With strenuous efforts, it has started from scratch and
successfully met the livelihood needs of its 160 million population, contributing
significantly to global poverty reduction. In recent years, by seizing the
opportunities of economic globalization and focusing on reform and
development, Bangladesh has kept its economy growing at above 6% and made
steady progress in industrialization and urbanization. Bangladesh is well on track
to achieve Vision 2021 and become a middle-income country.
The people of China and Bangladesh have been good neighbors and friends since
ancient times. Stories of our friendship and exchange witnessed by the Southern
Silk Road and the Maritime Silk Road throughout the millennia are still being told
today. Eminent Chinese monks Faxian and Xuanzang travelled west for Buddhist
scriptures. Ati ś a Dipankara Shrijnana, a Bengali religious master, spread
Buddhism in China. They were the pioneers of our cultural exchange. Famous
navigator Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty visited Bengal twice. According to his
description, “This is a richly endowed and teeming land with lovely people and
fertile fields.” Believed by the Chinese then to be a qilin (an auspicious mythical
animal), the giraffe that the Bengali king gave to the Ming emperor brought much
excitement to the court and general public in China.
More recently, having endured repeated wars and incessant poverty, our peoples
fought tenaciously for national independence and liberation, strove for
development and progress and forged unshakable trust and friendship in the
process. In the 1950s and 1960s, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Dhaka twice and
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman visited China twice. The seed of
friendship was thus planted by the veteran leaders of our two countries long
before diplomatic ties were established. It has now grown into a giant tree with
deep roots and rich fruits.
As a Chinese proverb goes, “Only friendships built on sincerity can last long.”
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 41 years ago, China has always
regarded Bangladesh as its true friend and partner for development. China highly
values its relations with Bangladesh. We firmly support each other on issues
concerning each other's core interests. Successive Chinese and Bangladeshi
leaders have maintained sound interactions at bilateral and multilateral events
and provided positive guidance to the growth of bilateral relations. In September
2015, I had a good meeting with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in New York on the
margins of the UN summits marking its 70th anniversary. We agreed to expand
cooperation across the board, jointly advance the Belt and Road initiative and the
BCIM Economic Corridor and take bilateral relations to a new height.
With the unremitting efforts of our two peoples, China-Bangladesh practical
cooperation has produced fruitful results. China is now the largest trading
partner of Bangladesh and Bangladesh China's third largest trading partner and
third largest project contract market in South Asia. Bilateral trade soared from
US$900 million in 2000 to US$14.7 billion in 2015, registering an annual increase
of around 20%. Jute products from Bangladesh are increasingly popular in the
Chinese market. Chinese companies have built the Shahjalal Fertilizer Factory,
the most advanced modern fertilizer plant in Bangladesh, the Bangabandhu
International Conference Center, the largest one in Bangladesh, and are now
building the Padma Bridge, the dream bridge of the Bangladeshi people. As a
matter of fact, one can find Chinese and Bangladeshi people together making
tireless and pioneering efforts in many sectors of Bangladesh such as
transportation, electricity, energy and telecommunications. One of the first batch
of projects financed by loans from the China-initiated Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank is the Power Grid Network Strengthening Project in Bangladesh,
which will benefit tens of millions of rural residents. We have also made
significant progress in our cooperation in defense, security, education, culture
and other fields.
Both China and Bangladesh are developing countries with a huge population. Our
national conditions have a lot in common and our development goals are well-
aligned. The “Sonar Bangla” dream of national strength and prosperity is in
perfect harmony with the Chinese dream of great national renewal. The Belt and
Road initiative put forward by China heralds new opportunities for win-win
cooperation between our two countries. Bangladesh, with its favorable
geographic location and huge population, market potential and cooperation
space, is an indispensable partner for China to advance the Belt and Road
initiative and production capacity cooperation in South Asia and the Indian
Ocean region.
During this visit, I look forward to working with Bangladeshi leaders to further
grow our bilateral relations, identify key areas of cooperation, advance exchanges
and cooperation in various fields and bring China-Bangladesh relations to a new
level.
— We need to step up political communication for greater mutual trust.
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman put forward the vision of “friendship to
all, malice to none”. China will always be Bangladesh's trustworthy friend and
partner. Our two sides should, from a strategic perspective, strengthen high-level
exchanges and top-level planning, cement traditional friendship and political
ties, set more ambitious goals and build a better framework for our bilateral
relations and lay a solid foundation for lasting friendship and all-round
cooperation.
— We need to align our development strategies for win-win outcomes. There is
huge potential and complementarity in our cooperation. China is ready to
synergize its 13th Five-Year Plan with Bangladesh's Seventh Five-Year Plan with a
view to leveraging our respective comparative advantages, increasing economic
exchanges and trade, building key projects in areas such as infrastructure,
production capacity, energy, electricity, transportation, information,
telecommunications and agriculture, strengthening practical cooperation under
the BCIM Economic Corridor and delivering to our people tangible benefits of our
cooperation.
— We need to enhance South-South cooperation for common development. China
stands ready to offer more assistance and support to Bangladesh to the best of its
capability, enhance mutual assistance and cooperation with Bangladesh in areas
such as disaster prevention and mitigation, vocational training, medical and
health-care services, climate change and women and children, work together
with Bangladesh to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and
make China-Bangladesh cooperation a fine example of South-South cooperation. 
— We need to build a bridge of friendship for greater affinity and mutual
understanding. Friendship between our two countries dates back a long time. In
fact, both the Chinese and Bangladeshi people drink water from the same
river,known as Yarlung Zangbo River in China and Jamuna River in Bangladesh.
China will work to increase exchanges and mutual learning between the Chinese
and Bangladeshi culture so as to bring our people closer to each other. It is
important that we facilitate exchanges and cooperation in areas such as
education, media, think tanks, tourism and youth and at the sub-national level so
that more of our people will be mobilized to support closer ties between China
and Bangladesh.
I believe with the joint efforts of our two peoples, China-Bangladesh cooperation
will bear even more golden fruits.",0.185723291,0.435765317,,Positive

Foreign adviser’s China tour: Dhaka-
Beijing relations to hit reset button
Mon Jan 20, 2025 12:00 AM
Last update on: Wed Jan 22, 2025 07:00 PM
Say foreign policy experts
Beijing may consider Bangladesh's political stability and diplomatic
positioning before making any commitment on economic and trade benefits
that Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain will seek during his four-day visit to
China, said foreign policy analysts.
""China always emphasises on political stability -- it is unlikely that China will go
for any concrete commitment to new funding or providing trade benefits to the
current interim government that's temporary in nature,"" said Sk Tawfique M
Haque, director of the South Asian Institute of Policy and Governance at North
South University.
During the visit, Dhaka will solicit the lowering of interest rates from 2-3 percent
to 1 percent for Chinese loans, the waiving of loan commitment fees and
extension of the grace period from 15 years to 30 years.
Duty-free access to Bangladeshi products after graduation from the least-
developed country bracket in 2026, more Chinese investments and higher exports
to China will also be sought, The Daily Star has learnt from foreign ministry
officials involved with the proceedings.
Beijing may press Dhaka for joining the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and
try to understand Bangladesh's diplomatic positioning, especially as the interim
government seems to be more pro-Western.
While the Western powers immediately welcomed the political changeover in
Bangladesh in August, China took time to analyse the changed reality here, Haque
said.
""China has overcome its initial inertia and is now normalising the relations with
Bangladesh -- this visit is part of that process,"" he said.
Hossain's visit comes on the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
There might not be new Chinese investment before the political government is in
power, said Munshi Faiz Ahmad, Bangladesh's former ambassador to China.
However, regular trade and economic activities need to be on the right track.
China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner, with the bilateral trade amounting
to $25 billion.
Bangladesh's exports to China, however, are below $1 billion.
China is Bangladesh's fourth-largest lender after Japan, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank.
Chinese loans have surged, exceeding $1 billion annually since 2021-2022. The
total Chinese loans disbursed since 1975 is $7.5 billion.
With the development of a number of mega projects over the last decade,
Bangladesh now faces a huge challenge in foreign debt repayment.
""We would seek the lowering of loan interest rates from the Chinese side to ease
our economic woes,"" Hossain told reporters last week.
During her last visit to China in early July last year, former Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina had sought 36 billion yuan, equivalent to $5 billion, as soft loans from
China, but China had offered only one billion Yuan (about $140 million).
The Chinese offer frustrated Hasina, who was tilted towards India and moved
away from China to India regarding the Teesta river management project.
""Now, Bangladesh is not tilted towards India and should take decisions
independently for national interest,"" Haque said.
Bangladesh is a member of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which the
Western countries term China's geopolitical project.
""So, there should not be a problem for Bangladesh in joining the GDI,"" Haque
said.
The interim nature of the government prevents it from joining the GDI as it has
foreign policy implications, Ahmad said.
A foreign ministry official said apart from lowering of the interest rates,
Bangladesh will seek to speed up the disbursement of loans that have been slow
over the last few months and buy four vessels and railway coaches.
He said Bangladesh will also seek detailed information on China's plan to build a
mega-hydropower dam across the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which can have
implications on the lower riparian countries including India and Bangladesh.
Meanwhile, during a meeting with Hossain at the foreign ministry yesterday,
Chinese Ambassador Yao Wen said they are ready to sign ""implementation plan""
on exchange of hydrological information with Bangladesh during the visit.
Yao also told Hossain that China is ""seriously considering"" lowering its interest
rates for Bangladesh.
Hossain sought Chinese support for developing fruit storage and preservation
capacity in Bangladesh.
He also said Bangladesh is ready to provide land and other logistics for setting up
a full-fledged tertiary-level Chinese hospital in Purbachal.
He also requested China to designate at least three to four top-notch hospitals in
Kunming so that Bangladesh nationals can go there for advanced treatment.
Rohingya issue will also feature prominently during Hossain's visit to Beijing,
especially on improving the conditions in Rakhine State for the Rohingya to
return, Hossain said.
Dhaka needs to engage the Arakan Army (AA) to secure the Bangladesh border
with Myanmar as it is now controlled by the AA, Haque said.
""India and China are both engaging with the Arakan Army. Why not us? We have
greater security issues along the border,"" he said.

opportunities for both countries and China will establish itself as a partner, he added.
Dhaka University economics professor MM Akash said there are economic aspects, as well
as a political aspect of China's economic assistance to Bangladesh including the BRI.
Chain has openly extended political support to Bangladesh, especially, to the ruling party,
disregarding its past policy.
Center for Alternatives executive director and Dhaka University international relation
professor Imtiaz Ahmed presented the keynote paper at the seminar. He said the Chinese
infrastructures ensure stability against the conception of instability. However, some
aspects should be considered, he added.
According to Imtiaz Ahmed, civil society should be more involved to make people aware of
the positive and negative sides of projects, and if that happens, no certain quarters will be
able to do politics on Chinese projects for their own interest.
Since China is coming with huge investment under the BRI project, the country must
respect political, citizen and human rights, he added.
Dhaka University development studies department professor Rashed Al Mahmud Titumir
said everyone must be alert in the perspective of the global competition centering the
Indo-Pacific region. If conflict spreads out in these regions, investment will be at risk, he
added.

Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Monday said as Bangladesh has witnessed
the most significant political change in its national history, the future of Bangladesh-China
relations in a post-revolution setting requires a more comprehensive approach.
""It is likely that the post-revolution trajectory of Bangladesh and its future relations with
China might be influenced by various factors, including Bangladesh's political stability, andBN

The adviser made the remarks while speaking at a seminar on ""Bangladesh-China
Relations: A Future Outlook"" at InterContinental Hotel in Dhaka.
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen and experts from both sides spoke at the
seminar, according to UNB.
Although the future of bilateral ties between Bangladesh and China can be shaped by
several factors, Adviser Hossain said, the core elements of cooperation, such as aspects of
trade and investment, infrastructure development, and technology sharing, need to
endure, since these aspects are propelled by mutual interests in economic advancement
and regional stability.
In the coming days, he said, along with focusing on the core elements, both countries can
also expedite meaningful collaboration on several other emerging areas, such as green
energy, tourism, satellite technology and climate change.
Also, to devise a mutually beneficial future outlook of the bilateral ties between the two
countries, new avenues of collaboration need to be explored by both sides, he said.
""I believe the exchange of ideas will help us more to understand how the future course of
the bilateral relations between the two countries will evolve in the midst of evolving
internal, regional and global dynamics,"" Hossain said.
He also talked about how this bilateral cooperation can contribute in reorienting
Bangladesh's post-revolution economic trajectory, and how this bilateral cooperation
needs to advance in the context of the country's changing political landscape.
Over the past years, since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the adviser said, China and
Bangladesh have relentlessly valued each other as equals, pursued mutual benefits and
advantageous outcomes.
Both countries, from the very beginning, supported each other on matters of core interests,
and worked together on the path to realising their respective development, he said.
Hence, the Foreign Affairs Adviser said, the diplomatic ties between Bangladesh and China
set an example of amicable coexistence and cooperative success.

Kazi Anis Ahmed, Publisher""You can tap into the advantages of business in Bangladesh,"" he said at an investment dialogue
with Chinese business leaders at The Presidential in Beijing.
Yunus said Bangladesh is the second largest RMG manufacturer after China and that Bangladesh
is located in an amazing location, which has potential for regional trade and business. 
Nepal and Bhutan are landlocked countries as they have no sea. Same as to the seven-sisters-
states of India, he said, laying importance on establishing connectivity with those areas to boost
trade.
Highlighting the human resource potential of Bangladesh, Yunus said that despite being one of
the most densely populated nations, Bangladesh has a huge youthful manpower full of energy,
creativity and aspiration. 
He stressed the need for utilising the untapped potential of Bangladesh's young people, saying:
""There is no shortage of young people -- both men and women,"" he said. 
About Bangladesh's recent transformation, Yunus said Bangladesh has emerged as a completely
""new Bangladesh."" Emerging youths will help running trade and business, he said.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/asia/326750/pro-china-candidate-wins-maldives-presidency 1/3Pro-China candidate Mohamed Muizzu won Saturday's presidential election in the Maldives, a
result set to once again upend the archipelago's relationship with traditional benefactor India.
Muizzu, 45, helms a party that presided over an influx of Chinese loans when it last held power
in the atoll nation, better known for its luxury beach resorts and celebrity tourists.
He won 54.06% of the vote in the run-off contest, prompting incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih
to concede defeat shortly before midnight.
""Congratulations to president-elect Muizzu,"" Solih wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""I also
congratulate the people who have shown a peaceful and democratic process.""
Muizzu made a brief appearance outside his party's campaign headquarters to urge supporters not
to celebrate until Sunday morning, when campaign restrictions officially come to an end. 
Solih, 61, will serve as caretaker president until his successor is inaugurated on November 17. 
The result upends Solih's efforts to revert the country's diplomatic posture back towards New
Delhi since taking office five years ago.
Muizzu played a pivotal role in an earlier government's development program, bankrolled in part
by financial largesse from China's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
He told a meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials last year that his party's return to
office would ""script a further chapter of strong ties between our two countries.""
Geopolitical hotspot
The Maldives sits in a strategically vital position in the middle of the Indian Ocean, astride one of
the world's busiest east-west shipping lanes.
Muizzu's mentor, former president Abdulla Yameen, borrowed heavily from China for
construction projects and spurned India.
Solih was elected in 2018 on the back of discontent with Yameen's increasingly autocratic rule,
accusing him of pushing the country into a Chinese debt trap.

Kazi Anis Ahmed, PublisherYameen's turn towards Beijing had also alarmed New Delhi, which shares concerns with the
United States and its allies about China's growing assertiveness in the Indian Ocean. 
India is a member of the strategic Quad alliance alongside the United States, Australia and Japan.
But Solih's restoration of the Maldives' traditional posture itself proved controversial, with many
in the archipelago disapproving of India's outsized political and economic clout. 
Muizzu has vowed to free Yameen, currently serving an 11-year sentence for corruption on the
same prison island where he had jailed many of his political opponents during his tenure.
In his brief appearance Saturday, Muizzu urged the outgoing president to use his executive power
and transfer Yameen to house arrest.
Turnout in Saturday's poll was 85%, slightly higher than the first-round vote held earlier this
month.
Watchdog group Transparency Maldives said there had been some incidents of ""electoral
violence,"" without specifying further details. 
Officials said one voter broke open a plastic ballot box, but the ballots were saved and there was
no interruption to the count.
Police reported arresting 14 people, mostly for taking photographs of their marked ballot papers
and sharing them on social media.

Annual turnover peaks on huge capital goods imports

Economic ties between Bangladesh and China have deepened significantly, with
Bangladeshʼs imports from the worldʼs second-largest economy continuing to grow despite
ongoing import restrictions—largely thanks to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).BN
25/05/2025, 11:39 Annual turnover peaks on huge capital goods imports | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/annual-turnover-peaks-on-huge-capital-goods-imports 1/10This trade expansion has strengthened the countryʼs export capabilities and contributed to
its overall economic growth.
Introduced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, the BRI saw Bangladesh join in 2016,
initiating an era of enhanced bilateral trade, according to economists.
During President Xiʼs visit to Bangladesh in 2016, he pledged US$40 billion for a number of
infrastructure projects, further cementing economic collaboration under the BRI
framework.
Trade between the two nations has grown significantly in recent years, with bilateral trade
standing at $11.56 billion in 2018. It rose by 8.53 per cent to $12.54 billion in 2019 and
reached the bilateral relations at $19.3 billion in the fiscal year 2023, according to the
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the national statistical organisation.
Since 2018, China has been Bangladeshʼs largest trading partner, overtaking neighbouring
India, which now ranks second.
Economists acknowledge the substantial trade deficit with China but emphasise the critical
role of Chinese capital goods in supporting the countryʼs economic momentum.
These goods –industrial raw materials—essential for the countryʼs $450 billion economy,
where the industrial sector contributes 23 per cent —fuel growth by enabling export-driven
industries.
Dr. Wahiduddin Mahmud, a prominent economist and professor of economics, highlights
Bangladeshʼs dependence on Chinese imports for raw materials and machinery,
particularly for the export-oriented manufacturing sector.
“Bangladesh depends on industrial raw materials from China to make garments for
exports,” said Professor Wahiduddin Mahmud about import dividends.
Bangladeshʼs primary export markets include the European Union and North America.
Similarly, Dr. M. Masrur Reaz, chairman of Policy Exchange of Bangladesh, a privately-
owned think tank in Bangladesh, argued that the trade deficit with China should not be a
concern, as Chinese goods dominate the Bangladeshi market due to their cost
competitiveness.
Chinese goods dominate the Bangladeshi market due to their competitive prices, especially
in machinery vital for the ready-made garment (RMG) industry.25/05/2025, 11:39 Annual turnover peaks on huge capital goods imports | The Financial Express
https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/bangladesh/annual-turnover-peaks-on-huge-capital-goods-imports 2/10“If China import grows, it has positive contributions to Bangladesh exports,” Dr. Masrur
added.
Yet, the rapid expansion of its garment industry—employing around 5.0 million workers,
most of them women—has deepened trade ties with China.
Bangladesh, the worldʼs second-largest apparel exporter after China, heavily relies on
Chinese machinery and raw materials.
Bangladesh has been pursuing import restrictions since the beginning of the war in Ukraine
in February in 2022 as its foreign exchange reserves have been depleting rapid.
Syed Nazrul Islam, managing director of Well Dress, a concern of leading conglomerate ---
Well Food Group ---vividly described this dependence: “We canʼt afford not to buy from
China; our entire supply chain would collapse.”
The hum of Chinese-made automatic sewing machines in his factory illustrates how
imported technology drives Bangladeshʼs economic resilience.
Former BGMEA president Anwar Ul Alam Chowdhury highlighted the role of Chinese
machinery in making Bangladeshʼs ready-made garment (RMG) industry more cost-25/05/2025, 11:39 Annual turnover peaks on huge capital goods imports | The Financial Express

China offers competitive prices, has wide range of products, according to industrialist Mr.
Chowdhury.
“Chinaʼs products are integral to our industry. We cannot imagine operating without them,”
he said.
He pointed out that infrastructure projects under the BRI are enhancing Bangladeshʼs
competitiveness in global trade.
“When oneʼs trading partner improves, it impacts associated economies. We have largely
benefited from China, which is our largest trading partner,” Mr. Chowdhury also managing
director of leading clothing giant –Evince Group---noted.
In the meantime, Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh has surged since
the country joined the BRI.
Over the past decade, Bangladesh has received more than $2.6 billion in FDI from China,
primarily for infrastructure projects such as rail links, power plants, and logistics facilities.
A notable example is Alipayʼs 2018 acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in bKash, Bangladeshʼs
largest mobile financial service provider.
Dr. Zahid Hussain, another leading economist, emphasized the importance of Chinese
imports for Bangladeshʼs growth, particularly in machinery and raw materials critical to
export-driven and domestic industries.25/05/2025, 11:39 Annual turnover peaks on huge capital goods imports | The Financial Express

Our most machinery, raw goods coming from China, according to Dr. Hussain.
He said that the FDI from China is crucial for Bangladesh, as funding for BRI projects from
Chinese banks is more accessible compared to multilateral funding organisations.
Bangladeshʼs imports from China—primarily machinery, electronics, textiles, chemicals,
and industrial inputs—account for 70 per cent of its total imports.
By contrast, its exports to China are limited to jute yarn, leather, and knitwear.
Globally, China maintains trade surpluses with 174 countries, including the United States,
while running deficits with oil-producing nations and countries like Japan and South Korea
that supply electronics and machinery.
Despite Bangladeshʼs trade imbalance with China, the experts contend that the economic
benefits—including job creation, industrial growth, and infrastructure development—
outweigh concerns over the deficit.
Reliance on Chinese capital goods will likely sustain Bangladeshʼs economic resilience in
the years to come.

Update : 16 Mar 2024, 09:00 AM
Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen has observed that many countries share the same
position with Beijing in safeguarding the national sovereignty and independence of Bangladesh
and opposing external interference during the election period. In an interview with Dhaka
Tribune’s Diplomatic Correspondent Nurul Islam Hasib recently, the envoy shared his
observations about Dhaka as he completed a little more than one year of his assignment. He said
China is truly committed to helping Bangladesh in its development and construction.
Dhaka Tribune: You have completed a year in Dhaka. What has surprised you in terms of
what you expected to see?
Yao Wen: How time flies. It has been one year and two months since I came to Dhaka. The past
year has been very important in the history of Bangladesh and also for the China-Bangladesh
Strategic Partnership of Cooperation. I would like to share with you some observations that
impressed me most.
First, the Bangladeshi people are very friendly towards China. Over the past year, I have visited
many places in Bangladesh, had extensive contacts with all sectors of society, and reached out to
the grass-roots people.
What I have experienced most is the simple and sincere affection of the Bangladeshi people
towards China and the Chinese people. According to the survey on the National Image of China,Publish : 16 Mar 2024, 09:00 AM

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/341899/ambassador-many-countries-align-with-china-in 2/7which has been conducted for two consecutive years, over 90% of the respondents are satisfied
with the status quo of China-Bangladesh relations and support further development. And the
percentage of people holding the same position is increasing. I have to say that people-to-people
affection is deeply rooted in the thousand-year-long history of friendly exchanges between the
two countries. And it is nurtured by the common principles of mutual respect, equality, and win-
win cooperation between the two sides. China is truly committed to helping Bangladesh in its
development and construction, and hopes that the Bangladeshi people could enjoy a happier life.
Second, Bangladesh has great potential for development. Let me cite a set of figures to prove it.
At the time of the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, its GDP was only $6.29 billion, with a
growth rate of negative 14% and a per capita GDP of only $90.7.
After 50 years of development, in 2022, its GDP exceeded $460 billion, with a growth rate of
7.1%, and an average annual growth rate of more than 6% over the past decade.
Per capita GDP is nearly $2,800, surpassing India for four consecutive years and Pakistan for
eight consecutive years. In addition to the achievements in the economic field, the level of
development in the social and welfare fields in Bangladesh has also improved significantly.
Bangladesh is the first country in South Asia to join the Belt and Road Initiative. Over the past
eight years, the BRI has taken root and blossomed in the golden Bay of Bengal, being involved
in, and witnessing the sweeping changes that have taken place in Bangladesh.
It is with no exaggeration that the city of Dhaka looks like a big construction site, and is vibrant
and alive with new projects every single day. Fourteen mega infrastructure projects aided or
constructed by the Chinese government have been completed or commenced during the past year,
making significant contributions to improving people's livelihoods and upgrading infrastructure
conditions in Bangladesh.
With the continuous strengthening of China-Bangladesh Strategic Partnership of Cooperation and
the deepening of practical cooperation in various fields, China will continue to provide support
and assistance for the development of Bangladesh and help Bangladesh achieve “Vision 2041”
and ""Smart Bangladesh"" at an early date.
The general election was a major issue during your tenure. China was quite vocal against
Western statements on Bangladesh in the run-up to the elections. Washington said they
were helping Bangladesh in the democratic process. Beijing called it internal interference.
Why did you think that?

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/341899/ambassador-many-countries-align-with-china-in 3/7China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace, in which non-interference in other
countries' internal affairs is an important principle. On the issue of the 12th National Parliament
Election, the Chinese Government maintained a consistent position with a clear and firm attitude.
We have always believed that the election is an internal affair that should not be subject to any
external interference. How Bangladesh will develop in the future, nobody but the Bangladeshi
people have the say. We are glad to see that the election was finally conducted smoothly as
scheduled despite tremendous pressure and challenges.
Chinese leaders sent the letters of congratulations to the Hon’ble Prime Minister immediately
after the election, indicating that they stand ready to work with the Bangladeshi side to uplift the
China-Bangladesh Strategic Partnership of Cooperation to a new height.
What I would like to point out is that there are many countries that share the same position with
China, supporting Bangladesh in safeguarding national sovereignty and independence, opposing
external interference and standing firmly on the side of the people of Bangladesh. On the
contrary, some certain countries are interfering in the name of democracy, as if their democracy
and elections are superior and perfect. Is that the truth? The people of Bangladesh see it clearly.
Chinese railway technology is world class: do you see any prospect of Bangladesh being
linked from top to bottom with a high-speed rail network?
Railway cooperation is an important part of China-Bangladesh relations and has achieved fruitful
results in recent years. Last year, Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina attended the
inauguration ceremony of the Dhaka-Bhanga section of Padma Bridge rail link and the Railway
Line from Dohazari to Cox's Bazar built by Chinese enterprises. Up to now, Chinese companies
have built seven railways in Bangladesh. These mega projects play an important role in
Bangladesh's economic and social development and help to provide job opportunities to local
people.
China has rich experiences and advanced technologies in railway construction. China stands
ready to strengthen communication and cooperation with Bangladesh, and is willing to be deeply
involved in Bangladesh railway construction. Should the Bangladeshi side have new suggestions
of cooperation, please feel free to formally submit to the Chinese side.
How should Bangladesh manage its geopolitical relations given the increasing tensions
between the US and China?
Major countries shoulder critical responsibilities for global strategic stability. As President Xi
Jinping noted, major-country competition is not the prevailing trend of current times. For major

coordination; the more acute the risks and challenges, the greater the need to advance
cooperation. China will be a force for stability in promoting cooperation between major
countries.
This year marks the 45th anniversary of China-US diplomatic relations. Past experience and
lessons show that when China and the United States work together, great things can be
accomplished for the two countries and the entire world, while a confrontational posture between
the two countries hurts both sides and the world at large. At the end of last year, the Chinese and
US presidents held an important summit meeting, which laid out a future-oriented San Francisco
vision. In the meantime, China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests and push
back against containment and suppression. With a sense of responsibility for history, for the
people and for the world, China will work with the United States to implement the common
understandings between the two presidents and move bilateral relations forward along the right
path of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.
Dr Hasan Mahmud, the new Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, affirms his adherence to the foreign
policy of “friendship to all, malice towards none”, with importance to be laid on both the East
and the West. This is appreciated by the Chinese side.
Two-way trade is growing. But it's obviously in favour of China. Do you have any plans to
balance the trade? Any plans to sign an FTA with Bangladesh?
In recent years, bilateral trade between China and Bangladesh has developed rapidly. China has
maintained Bangladesh's largest trading partner for the past 13 consecutive years, and Bangladesh
is also China's third largest trading partner in South Asia. The trade structures of the two
countries are complementary and have played a positive role in the economic development of
both countries.
I understand that many Bangladeshi friends pay attention to the trade imbalance between China
and Bangladesh. Let me share with you the data. In 2023, Bangladesh's trade deficit with China
dropped by 15%, indicating that the trade imbalance condition between China and Bangladesh
has been effectively improved.
As you said, China-Bangladesh trade is in favour of China, but Bangladesh has also gained huge
benefits from it. On one hand, 85% of Bangladesh's exports are RMG, and about 80% of the raw
materials come from China. It is China-Bangladesh trade that ensures the production and export
of Bangladesh's RMG, thereby helping Bangladesh to realize the export diversification strategy.
x25/05/2025, 15:14 Ambassador: Many countries align with China in backing Bangladesh
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/341899/ambassador-many-countries-align-with-china-in 5/7On the other hand, a large part of China's exports to Bangladesh are machinery and parts, which
ensures Bangladesh's infrastructure construction needs, thereby promoting Bangladesh's
economic development and increasing employment. Therefore, I can say that China-Bangladesh
trade is mutually beneficial.
China has never pursued a trade surplus with Bangladesh. In recent years, China has taken
pragmatic measures to expand imports from Bangladesh. This year, Bangladesh mango is
expected to be exported to China. China welcomes Bangladesh to actively participate in the CIIE,
the Canton Fair, etc., and supports Bangladesh in holding jute, leather and other special product
exhibitions in China to promote more Bangladeshi high-quality products to enter the Chinese
market.
I am also very happy to see that Bangladeshi media friends are paying attention to the China-
Bangladesh FTA. Signing of the China-Bangladesh FTA will help Bangladesh successfully
graduate from LDCs in 2026, import Chinese products needed for Bangladesh's economic
development and industrial upgrading, and also ensure export of Bangladeshi high-quality
products to China, such as jute, leather, mango, and aquatic products. Meanwhile, the China-
Bangladesh FTA will also strengthen investment cooperation between the two countries, helping
Bangladesh to attract more Chinese investment, and promote Bangladesh’s economic and social
development. China hopes to work with Bangladesh to complete the feasibility study on the FTA,
and formally kick off the negotiations as early as possible, so as to sign it before 2026.
Do you see any prospect of Rohingya repatriation? What’s the current situation in
Myanmar alongside the repatriation?
With China's unremitting efforts and continuous mediation, Bangladesh and Myanmar have been
working together and made significant progress since last April, sending out goodwill to each
other and making a series of agreements on the commencement of repatriation. Both sides
achieved unprecedented progress. For example, the Bangladeshi side sent a “go & see”
delegation to Myanmar to inspect the situation of the resettlement villages, and the Myanmar side
sent two “come & talk” delegations to Bangladesh, and both sides jointly carried out identity
verification of displaced people.
What I would like to emphasize is that repatriation is the only solution to the issue. And this is
widely recognized by all the parties concerned. It is only a matter of time for the repatriation to
commence. Although repatriation has been suspended for the time being due to the internal
conflict in Myanmar, the parties concerned remain determined to carry forward the repatriation
process.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/167886/why-does-india-cautiously-watch-bangladesh’s 1/4In recent years, China has committed funding worth billions of dollars to countries across the
subcontinent to fulfill President Xi Jinping’s plans to build a new global trade route.
The Chinese president’s visit to Bangladesh in 2016 was marked by over US$20bn in loan
agreements, indicating growing ties between Beijing and Dhaka.
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina however, as of now, has been maintaining a balance
with the two big neighbours.
For instance, Dhaka’s keen interest in the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Forum for Regional
Cooperation (BCIM) economic corridor has rung alarm bells in Delhi.
China now maintains that the BCIM is a part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
India, however, has been reluctant to attach itself to BRI. Part of this hesitance is rooted in
concerns about Chinese intentions and the possibility of misusing the BRI as geo strategic
leverage against India.
India has also refused to be part of the BRI plan due to the involvement of China in Pakistan,
particularly in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (Cpec) which transgresses Indian-claimed
but Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
Delhi’s clear message on BCIM to Dhaka is that it will only be on board if it has no links with
China’s BRI.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/167886/why-does-india-cautiously-watch-bangladesh’s 2/4Former diplomat Rajeet Mitter, who had served as an envoy to Dhaka, leads the Indian side in the
BCIM economic corridor.
He said: “The Belt Road Initiative was floated just two or three years ago, while negotiations
over the BCIM corridors have been going on for 20 years. We think there is no option to consider
these matters as a single issue.”
Free trade agreement
Another pressing concern for New Delhi is the free trade agreement (FTA), an issue raised by
Indian Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu during his Dhaka visit in September 2018.
A senior official of Indian Commerce Ministry said: “As soon as Bangladesh graduates from a
least developed nation, it will lose duty-free and quota-free access to Indian market.”
Wishing anonymity, the official added: “The existing trade pact within Saarc member states
(Safta) will not be enough for Bangladesh to enter freely into the Indian market, and that’s why
we are focusing on a bilateral deal like an FTA.” 
Two-way trade between the countries stood at $9.3bn in FY2018, up by $1.8bn from the previous
fiscal year.
Apart from India, Bangladesh has been in talks with several other countries, including Sri Lanka,
China and Pakistan, over FTAs.
Negotiations have significantly progressed with Sri Lanka and China, but not at all with India or
Pakistan.
Economic zone for Indian investment
In its bid to attract foreign direct investments (FDI), Bangladesh has said it will set up three
special economic zones for Indian investors.
India is keen to combine with Bangladesh to build a South Asian manufacturing supply chain that
uses their Bay of Bengal ports, cheap labour and raw materials to manufacture garments,
electronic goods and information technology services for export, according to media reports.
The proposed sites of the economic zones –Kushtia’s Bherhamara, Mirsharai Chattogram
(Chittagong) and Mongla –have failed to woo Indian investors.

(FICCI), said: “We have told the Indian government at least one and half year ago that investorsx

The toll of the Rohingya crisis on the economy
With a GDP per capita of $1,400, the Bangladeshi economy grew by 7.1% in 2016with
remarkable progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The Rohingya crisis, however, is straining Bangladesh. According to international agencies,
nearly 800,000 Rohingyas fled Myanmar since late 2017. Bangladesh is now home to nearly 1.1
million Rohingyas.
“It will hamper the progress and achievements in SDGs and MDGs,” Sarah Taylor, country
director of international NGO The Asia Foundation, said.
She said the Rohingya crisis is gradually casting a shadow on Bangladesh’s remarkable progress
in education, healthcare and socioeconomic indicators over the last decade.
“Bangladesh has graduated to a lower mid-income state from a least developed country, but the
next step can be tedious due to the refugee crisis,” she said.
While extensive international humanitarian relief has poured in to support the refugees, it does
not cover all the economic costs to the government or to Bangladeshi citizens in the border
region. The effect of the influx may not be apparent for some time.
The coastal town and beaches of Cox’s Bazar, which used to be Bangladesh’s main tourist
destination, now is awash with foreign aid workers. The area’s hoteliers are prospering, and many
Bangladeshis have found jobs with humanitarian organizations. But day laborers and locals have
complained about price hikes for basic goods, and about losing work to refugees willing to accept
far lower wages.x

BNP Standing Committee member Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan yesterday told a senior
leader of the Communist Party of China (CPC) that if his party is elected to power
in the next election, it will sign an agreement with China to implement the Teesta

River water management project.
""Chinese ambassador in Dhaka has recently made a clear proposal to assist us in
developing a project for managing the water of Teesta River,"" he said during a
meeting between a Bangladesh delegation and CPC Deputy Secretary of the
Shaanxi Provincial Committee Xing Shanping.
Dr Moyeen said the Chinese envoy had sincerely made the offer for the welfare of
thousands of people living along the riverbanks.
""On our behalf, I tell you that if the people of Bangladesh elect us to government
in the next election, we will be very happy to sign a deal to receive your support
in developing a complete Teesta Barrage,"" he said.
The BNP leader also mentioned that the Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh, Yao
Wen, told him he would personally visit the Teesta Barrage area.
The delegation, led by BNP Standing Committee member Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan,
attended the meeting and later joined a banquet hosted by the CPC leader at a
hotel in the province.
Earlier, on Tuesday, the 21-member delegation, consisting of leaders from eight
political parties, including the BNP, travelled to China for an 11-day visit at the
invitation of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
Dr Moyeen said the current government is not taking the Teesta project since it is
a transitional administration.
""A stable government will be established through the polls, which will be able to
sign the deal and execute the project,"" the BNP leader told the meeting.
Dr Moyeen also hoped that China would continue supporting Bangladesh in
modernising its agriculture and irrigation systems, alongside its cooperation in
infrastructure development.
He mentioned that an increasing number of Bangladeshi students are pursuing
higher education in China, particularly in science, technology, and modern
disciplines, to contribute to national development.
The BNP leader hoped that China would offer more scholarships and enhance
student exchange programs to facilitate quality education for Bangladeshi
students.
About trade, he said China can supply high-quality essential items at affordable
prices to meet the needs of the Bangladeshi people.
In response, CPC Deputy Secretary Xing Shanping reaffirmed China's strong
commitment to its ties with Bangladesh, describing the country as a valued
neighbour.
She said bilateral relations between Bangladesh and China have strengthened
based on mutual cooperation and respect.
The CPC leader assured that China would continue its assistance for Bangladesh's
development and the welfare of its people.

said.

The Communist Party of Bangladesh and the W orkers Party expressed their solidarity with the initiative
during the programme and were allotted two vice-chairmen posts in the forum.
Journalist Shahiduzzaman Khan of Financial Express is the member secretary of the 49-member executive

The full committee will be formed soon, said Inu while announcing the names of the chairman, seven vice-

Prime Minister ’s International Affairs Adviser Gowher Rizvi and Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Zhang Zuo

https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/awami-league-bnp-unite-to-launch-bangladesh-china-silk-road-forum 3/12Bangladesh joined the BRI during Chinese President Xi Jinping’ s visit to Dhaka in 2016. The initiative aims
to rebuild the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond through massive infrastructural
spending.
However , the initiative has been the subject of controversy in many western capitals, particularly
Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and trap countries into
debt through “nontransparent” projects.
India did not join the BRI, citing concerns over China’ s projects with Pakistan. Some analysts say India is
not comfortable with Bangladesh’ s participation in the initiative.
“This is the time,” Rizvi said about the new Forum, adding that the government does not see any conflict in
the relations with India and China.
“Our support and participation in BRI does not exclude us from participation in other initiatives such as
Indo-Pacific strategy ,” he said as India is one of the key partners of the strategy pursued by the United
States.25/05/2025, 10:59 Awami League, BNP unite to launch Bangladesh China Silk Road Forum
https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/awami-league-bnp-unite-to-launch-bangladesh-china-silk-road-forum 4/12“We in Bangladesh do not see any conflict between the two. Both these have their own reasons and
purposes. Both of them will advance our goal and prosperity ,” he said.
“What is also very important that Indo-China relations over the last 10 years have improved phenomenally .
India is one of the largest trading partners of China. Their relations are improving. So we need not to worry
that one is at the cost of the other .
“This is not a zero-sum game. It’ s a positive-sum game. W e get benefit with all these initiatives and we
should place ourselves into these.”
Ambassador Zhang Zuo said the Bangladesh-China Silk Road Forum is being established “at the right
moment when there is a lot to be achieved”.
“Bangladesh’ s diplomatic policy of “friend to all, malice to none” and President Xi Jinping’ s ‘Thought of
diplomacy’, both have provided new opportunities for win-win cooperation for our two countries,” he said.
“Bangladeshi people’ s dream of a strong and wealthy nation, manifested in the dream of Sonar Bangla,
and the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation pursued by the Chinese people, are interconnected.”
Zuo hoped that this forum “could pay attention to telling good stories about China-Bangladesh friendship,
passing on the voices in the communication and exchanges between our two countries, and building this
forum into an important bridge for China-Bangladesh connectivity .”
Next year , Bangladesh and China will mark the 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties. “W e need to work
together to create a congenial atmosphere for cooperation and deepen our policy connectivity and people-
to-people bond, so as to bring more benefits to both our peoples, and push the China-Bangladesh relations
into a better new era.”Ad

balancing the world order .
“Purely western domination cannot bring good to total population,” he said. “There needs some kind of
balance in the world.”
“As it [BRI] unifies the world through the process of development, the BRI in fact is a global project,” he
said.
“We’ll move in the sense of a competition, not conflict which has become an apparent trend in the western
world.”
Columnist Abul Maksud described Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina “pragmatic” for maintaining balanced
relations with both India and China.
CPB Presidium member Abdullah Al Kafi Ratan expressed “solidarity” of his party with this new Forum.
Hasanul Haq Inu, who was the information minister of Hasina’ s last cabinet, said this forum will act as a
bridge between the regional and sub-regional forums.
The BRI will increase connectivity , increase the tourism industry , increase economic development and
trade, he said. “It’ll be a great boost for the economic development of Asia,” he said, urging all in
Bangladesh irrespective of political parties to support the BRI.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Wen has said that despite the “steady progress” of Dhaka-Beijing
relations, some “disturbing noises” emerge once in a while.
But there is no use of that as the relationship is “widely endorsed by all walks of life across the
country,"" he said while speaking at the reunion of Bangladeshi participants attending 2023
Chinese government training programs at the embassy on Tuesday night.
The ambassador did not mention specifically what the “disturbing noises"" were, but he mentioned
the China trap issue, which is widely reported by Western media.
“The so-called China trap is sheer fabrication,” he said, adding that the projects carried out by
Beijing under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) would bring about “China benefit.""
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI.
China also comes into the political limelight in Bangladesh for criticizing Western interference in
the upcoming general elections.
The ambassador said China and Bangladesh are “not only traditionally friendly neighbours but
also strategic partners.""
In recent years, the exchanges between the two countries have been increasingly close, and
economic and trade cooperation has yielded fruitful results, setting an example of win-win
cooperation among developing countries, he said.Publish : 28 No v 2023, 11:58 PM

China is also a major source of foreign investment for Bangladesh, with an investment stock of
$3.17 billion and more diversified investment sectors being explored.
Currently, there are around 700 Chinese companies registered in Bangladesh; they have
constructed 7 railways, 12 roads, 21 bridges, and 31 power plants, providing 550,000 job
opportunities, he said.
""2023 is a fruitful year for the Chinese government's training programs in Bangladesh. With the
resumption of physical training programs, we have witnessed a remarkable increase in the
number of participants in China,"" he said, adding that 370 Bangladeshi officials have participated
in this year's training programs.
With that, he said, the Chinese government's training programs in Bangladesh have sent
approximately 5,500 Bangladeshi officials, technical experts, young scholars, and media
representatives to receive training in China, and all the seminars have received unanimous
acclaim.
""2023 is a year for further deepening the strategic partnership between China and Bangladesh.""
Echoed by no one but to no avail
The ambassador said China is the most reliable development partner and a true friend of
Bangladesh. It is a conclusion widely endorsed by all walks of life across the country.
""However, alongside the steady progress of China-Bangladesh relations, some disturbing noises
emerge once in a while.""
""China-Bangladesh cooperation finds its roots deep in the long-established friendship between
the two peoples. It would have been impossible without the political guidance of our respective
leaderships.
“The precious achievement is jointly made by contributors from various sectors and positions like
you and thus should be cherished by heart and maintained with care.
“The attempts to interfere with China-Bangladesh cooperation will be echoed by no one but to no
avail,” he said, adding that through actions they would showcase to the world “what true friends
and best partners really mean.""

greater number of Bangladeshi participants.
“Right now, there have been 50 flights flying between China and Bangladesh every week, and
nearly 10 thousand people commute to and from our two countries on a weekly basis.”
“More direct flights from Dhaka to Beijing will be opened very soon, so as to provide more
diverse flight options and make people-to-people exchanges even more convenient,” he said.
The ambassador said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has commended BRI for opening a new door
of development for Bangladesh.
“I firmly believe that this door not only carries mega projects to drive economic development but
also nurtures people-to-people exchanges and mutual learning between the two countries,” he
said.
“China is committed to ensuring those training programs are well-implemented and built into an
important platform for bilateral exchanges, thereby bringing the China-Bangladesh strategic
partnership of cooperation to a new level.”

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/310501/envoy-dhaka-beijing-should-deepen-strategic 1/7Ambassador of China to Bangladesh Yao Wen on Saturday said Bangladesh and China ""should
deepen the strategic partnership"" for cooperation and explore new growth points.
""China is willing to work with Bangladesh to continue exploring cooperation opportunities under
the Global Development Initiative (GDI), Global Security Initiative (GSI) and Global
Civilization Initiative (GCI),"" he said.
In particular, the ambassador said they are willing to promote the upgrading of industries and
digitalization process in Bangladesh and to improve the quality and competitiveness of “Made in
Bangladesh”.
He was delivering a keynote speech at a symposium as part of the Cosmos Dialogue
Ambassadors' Lecture Series titled ""Bangladesh-China Relations: Prognosis for the Future"" at a
hotel in Dhaka.
The discussion was chaired and conducted by the President of Cosmos Foundation and renowned
scholar-diplomat and former Advisor on Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh Caretaker Government Dr
Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury.
While delivering the welcome remarks, Chairman of Cosmos Foundation Enayetullah Khan said
Bangladesh and China are moving closer together as friends on the international stage.
The ties received a major boost during the visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to China in 2019
and the watershed point of this transformation was President Xi Jinping's all-important visit to

partnership”.
""It is a great source of inspiration to Bangladeshis as we witness China's peaceful rise. We know
from President Xi that the Chinese people have a dream; so do we in Bangladesh as we strive to
achieve middle-income status, of which we are on the cusp,"" Khan said.
""It is my firmest conviction that ties with China will continue to form the bedrock of our efforts
to fulfill these aspirations,"" he added.
Dr Iftekhar Chowdhury said it appears to all of them that China is rising; and the Chinese saw
this as a peaceful rise.
UNB
“Now, being even more careful, they no longer talk of ‘peaceful rise' but only peaceful
development,” he said, adding that established global powers, of course, see this as a threat.
Referring to Prime Minister Hasina's visit to Beijing in 2014 and President Xi's visit to
Bangladesh in 2016, he said these visits saw an “all-weather” friendship elevate to a strategic
partnership.
Dr Iftekhar said Bangladesh-China relations are, therefore, emerging as an equation in the
diplomatic calculations in Asia that will not fully show for itself tomorrow, nor the day after but
in the long run in a continent where time for many is not the essence.
x25/05/2025, 15:04 Envoy: Dhaka, Beijing should deepen strategic partnership to explore new growth points
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/310501/envoy-dhaka-beijing-should-deepen-strategic 3/7Ambassador Yao said his country has noticed the “Indo-Pacific Outlook of Bangladesh” released
recently, and believes that many of its ideas are similar to those of China.
""China supports Bangladesh in playing a more active and more significant role in regional and
international affairs while preserving its foreign policy of independence,"" he said.
The world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century, and the pendulum of
prosperity is pivoting to the East, said the Chinese envoy.
""Both China and Bangladesh are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges,"" he said.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the launching of the BRI.
Eight mega projects in Bangladesh, such as the Padma Bridge Railway Link Project, will be
completed and put into use.
The construction of the Rajshahi Surface Water Treatment Plant Project will also kick off, said
the Ambassador sharing the outcomes of the high-level visits in 2016 and 2019 and deepening
cooperation under the BRI.
Talking about the future of relations, Ambassador Yao said Bangladesh and China should
continue to firmly support each other in following a development path that suits our respective
national conditions.
The modernization of both China and Bangladesh involves a huge population.
""We should always bear realities in mind as we address issues, make decisions, and take action.
We should adhere to the path of peaceful development, and refuse to tread the old path of war,
colonization, and plunder taken by some countries,"" he said.
""Standing on our own feet, both China and Bangladesh have made a miracle of rapid socio-
economic development, thus attracting the attention of the whole world,"" he added.
The envoy said China respects Bangladesh's choice of its own development path, and is willing to
strengthen strategic communication and mutual learning with Bangladesh on this basis.
""China and Bangladesh should continue to support each other on issues of core interests, and say
""no"" to external interference with one voice,"" he said.
Yao said Bangladesh and China should make the relations a model of friendship among
developing countries, thus making their contribution to the building of a human community with

Vice Dean for Research, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of
Singapore, Professor Kanti Bajpai, mentioned three opportunities where Bangladesh-China
would have fruitful relationships.
He said the first one is a diplomatic opportunity to play the role of a bridging nation in multiple
ways.
Kanti Bajpai also talked about cooperation on the climate change front and in the area of
renewables and bringing in new technologies.
Indo-Pacific Outlook
Highlighting Bangladesh's ""Indo-Pacific Outlook"" and China-Bangladesh cooperation Senior
Fellow and Secretary General of South Asia and China Center, Shanghai Institutes for
International Studies Liu Zongyi said Bangladesh released the ""Indo-Pacific Outlook"", which
formulates a blueprint for the interaction between Bangladesh and stakeholders in the Asia-
Pacific region.
“From my humble observation, the release of Bangladesh's ""Indo-Pacific Outlook"" is not only an
initiative for Bangladesh to maintain its diplomatic independence and pursue its own national
interests but also a helpless move under constant pressure from the United States and India to
take sides,” he said.
This document of Bangladesh, like that of Asean, is called Outlook, which itself shows its
neutrality rather than its specific strategic implications, said the expert.
“At the same time, I also noticed that Bangladesh's Indo-Pacific Outlook is tailored to the
country's specific threat perception and strategic reality, with a focus on managing non-traditional
security issues, strengthening connectivity, and promoting economic development and
prosperity,” Liu said.
He thinks Bangladesh's choice is representative of the global South. “In order to contain China
and Russia, the United States is now engaging in global diplomacy to gain support from
developing countries, regardless of the harm the United States has done to these countries
before.”
China dislikes the term ""Indo-Pacific"" because it is a geopolitical design aimed at China from its
source around 2006, and its security implications are obvious, Liu said.

relief, river governance, and urban river sewage treatment that Bangladesh particularly needs, he
said, Bangladesh and China can further strengthen cooperation and exchange.
Economic Miracle
Appreciating Bangladesh's infrastructure development, Professor of Institute of International
Studies, Fudan University, China Lin Minwang said Bangladesh is on the right path to becoming
the next economic miracle in the coming decades.
Talking about Bangladesh's balancing foreign policy, he said, “From the Chinese side, we are
really comfortable with Bangladesh's foreign policy which tries to make a balance between the
two powers in this region (China and India).”
Prof Lin said China was just seeking cooperation with Bangladesh in all areas, not just limited to
economy.
He said international companies including Japan and the US are paying attention to Bangladesh
and Bangladesh has more bargaining power now. “This is really beneficial to Bangladesh.”
Assistant Research Fellow, Institute for International Strategic and Security Studies, SIIS, China
LI Hongmei said she is very surprised to see the rapid development of Bangladesh. “I still see so
many construction sites on the roads. I think this is a land of hope for the future.”
Highlighting geopolitical completion among big powers, she said they are in a world of
uncertainty and turbulence.
She said the United States pays more attention to the Bay of Bengal and focuses more on
countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka which joined the BRI.
Prof Li laid emphasis on development and encouraged Bangladesh to engage with everyone in
the best
“We want development in the region,” she said, asking to join hands for realizing the Dream of
Sonar Bangla and the Chinese Dream.
Former Bangladesh High Commissioner to India and former Ambassador to the United States
Tariq A Karim said history matters and laid emphasis on having respect for the sovereignty of all
nations, the principle of noninterference, respect for territorial integrity and commitment to non-

critical for India at a time when China is expanding its military and economic might
through the multi-billion infrastructure project under the Belt and Road Initiative.
In 2015, the BBIN Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA) was signed after Pakistan objected to
a SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) Motor Vehicle Agreement.
While there has been a lull on the agreement, in February this year, a meeting on the
proposed MVA was held in New Delhi.
Though Bhutan has decided to play an observer and not be a full-fledged part of the
agreement, it has given a go-ahead to the project. However, sources said that New Delhi is
keen to have Bhutan on board.
Bhutan is not only a “dear friend” but also an important trade partner for India especially
for hydroelectricity requirements, said Gopal Krishna Agarwal, BJP’s spokesperson on
economic affairs.
“The BBIN project is important for the region and we will expedite it. Bhutan will play an
important role and through this the country will get access to ports. The project is
beneficial to all member countries which are closely linked to each other for trade and
other economic co-operation. We are keen to give it shape since it will increase regional
connectivity and increase trade and not because of other any external factors or
countries,” Agarwal told IndiaNarrative.com.
Realignments can have pivotal political implications for the region, with
India seeing its relative dominance challenged by an increasingly
regionally expansionist China
The Australian Institute of International Affairs (AIIA) pointed out that unlike the
previous governments, the NDA under prime minister Narendra Modi has increased its
attention to Bhutan.
“Modi chose to visit Bhutan as his first official diplomatic venture since his crushing
election victory in May. This was notable because Bhutan had, during the previous Indian
regime of prime minister Manmohan Singh, only featured in India’s priority zone as an
aid receiver for regional diplomacy. The impoverished Himalayan kingdom had never
been a neighbour important enough to deserve the first encounter,” the AIIA, an
independent, non-profit research organisation said.25/05/2025, 10:31 India bolstering links with Bhutan, Nepal to counter China’s BRI move

China and India.
The Netherlands based European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS), in a report
last month said that “maintaining and expanding its alliance with Bhutan is going to be of
paramount importance for India as New Delhi will remain keen to prevent further Chinese
incursions into Doklam and Bhutan more generally.”
Realignments can have pivotal political implications for the region, with India seeing its
relative dominance challenged by an increasingly regionally expansionist China, the
report said.
With China as the elephant in the room, India and Japan are making a conscious effort to
establish structural linkages that would connect Bhutan with the Indo-Pacific region.
India, with Japan as partner has cleared the construction of the longest bridge over the
Brahmaputra that will connect landlocked Bhutan and Northeast India, with Dan Nang in
Vietnam. With Bhutan at the back-end, the 19-kilometre Dhubri-Phulbari bridge
connects Dhubri in Assam with Phulbari in Meghalaya.
The flagship project, acquired sharp focus, after a 2018 agreement between India and the
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), for the infrastructure development of the
north-east. The gigantic effort will merge two parallel initiatives -- the New Delhi-led
India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway and the East-West Economic Corridor
(EWEC) marshalled by Japan in partnership with Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.
The joint foray is a fusion of India’s ‘Act East’ policy and Japan’s ‘Free and Open Indo-
Pacific’ strategy.
From the Indian end, the trilateral highway starts in Manipur from the border town of
Moreh, The Hindu reported. On entering Myanmar, it heads for Mandalay, the historic
city, on the east bank of the Irrawaddy river, 471 km away. From Mandalay, Myanmar’s
last royal capital before B British annexation, the highway heads towards the
Thai border, with Myawaddy being the last destination on the Myanmar side.
Myanmar’s officialdom is emphatic that Myawaddy -- the gateway to ASEAN -- has huge
potential as it can be easily connected with the Yangon deep water port, as well as the
Andaman Sea.25/05/2025, 10:31 India bolstering links with Bhutan, Nepal to counter China’s BRI move

Myawaddy is the junction of the two projects. It is the starting point of the East West
